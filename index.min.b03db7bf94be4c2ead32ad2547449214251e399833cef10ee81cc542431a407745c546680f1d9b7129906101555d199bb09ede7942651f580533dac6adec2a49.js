Challenge brief # As in Africa, raising the awareness levels of regular people in East Asia about blockchain and the Cardano network should be a priority for the Catalyst community. In this challenge, we provide funding for people who have learned about Cardano to take advantage of the community\u0026rsquo;s support and build on or use the Cardano network.
The nature of the proposals for this challenge is open-ended. Their only requirement is to originate or focus on East Asia and include east Asian team members or focus on East Asian participants.
For instance, the overwhelming majority of Stake Pools reside in North America and Europe. The Cardano network will be more resilient when Stake Pools are evenly distributed across the globe. The Catalyst community needs to step up and intentionally make that happen.
Cardano started life in East Asia (Japan and Hong Kong), and Emurgo focuses on East Asia. Let\u0026rsquo;s build upon that.
What this is: # A call to action; Activate the Cardano community\u0026rsquo;s ability to recognise, reward the opportunity to make the world a better place. East Asia is fertile ground for the adoption of Cardano. The return on intention (ROI) is likely to be high because projects in young and developing economies face less economic inertia.
Addressing different parts of the world directly and intentionally through funding challenges makes our community more accessible. It makes us more resilient. It helps us learn and understand the needs of communities that make up our ecosystem.
It is a vision that needs votes to become an achievement. When the challenge succeeds, the beneficiary is the whole Cardano community. It is a call to close our prejudices and open our eyes, hearts and minds to good people who lack the benefits many of us were born with—allowing others with fewer privileged circumstances to rise and succeed.

Problem statement # Participating in Catalyst is difficult when you live in the eastern time zone and your language is not English.
Describe your solution to the problem # Eastern TownHall supports eastern countries with events, and translating content. The aim is to increase participants by 20% for each fund.
Relevant experience # Co-Founders of Catalyst Swarm, Eastern Townhall, Catalyst School. IT \u0026amp; Software Engineering. educators and accountant in East Asia \u0026amp; Japan.
Detailed plan # The Eastern Townhall is a community-driven initiative growing Cardano in the Eastern Hemisphere and across Asia. We want to build a truly global economy and society. Our focus is on making the hard, possible. A place, a time, and a space where:
We can build knowledge, share information, connect and support each other. Language and culture are not an barrier to participation. We learn how to apply the technology, and community, to address local needs. Show how to use Cardano to increase our economic wellbeing. Enrich Cardano\u0026rsquo;s ecosystem with our stories, our energy, and our perspectives. The eastern hemisphere, East and Southeast Asia region unite culturally and linguistically a lot of countries. With a population of over 1.6 Billion, our goal is to grow Cardano.
Current Problems and Limitation # The Eastern Townhall is the result of individuals and groups working together. Each bringing a unique quality. We interact in and around the Cardano Community, focused on linking individuals and projects to Project Catalyst. But this takes time, effort, and incurs expenses. Having no pool of funds to draw upon limits what we can achieve.
Proposed Solution: Pool of Funds # To reach a global audience means meeting people where they are, in their country, their language and their culture.
We are an active part of our Cardano ecosystem. Our cornerstone event is the weekly Eastern Townhalls. But we are doing more, so much more:
We make knowledge and content accessible to as many cultures as possible. We host different events where community members come together We bridges to underrepresented groups We integrate local perspectives to enrich the Catalyst Community; and We listen! Gathering opinions and data to help us all understand. We are doing translations, building community, sharing knowledge, enabling entrepreneurs, and growing Cardano.
Doing all that has costs, so if we are to sustain the Eastern Townhall efforts, then we need to secure funding in a way that does not add extra effort to what we are already doing.
This proposal is about forming and maintain a pool of funds (a treasury) that is managed by the Eastern Townhall Trusted Seed. A pool of funds to spend at our discretion. The treasury will be used to cover expenses, to grow and sustain the efforts of the Eastern Townhall. Expenses like translation bounties; production of content; paying for online service subscriptions such as Zoom, Github, HackMD, Statbot and others; paying for activities related to organising the Eastern Town Hall.
Simply put this proposal is about funds for organising a community group. Establishing a resource and distributed support structure that provides funds needed on demand without the overhead of specific Catalyst proposals.
In return, we promise to report back financial statements on our activities and expenses. Translated into as many languages as we can find collaborators for. Our intent is to pioneer and prototype DAO treasury management[3] reporting. That is not a small matter and managing a shared pool of funds has plenty of compliance complications. The reporting effort is Similar in principal to the work being done by index.coop[4] and FWB[5]. Most DAOs are still figuring this out and the best practices are not even drafts, so help us work this out.
Learning how the Eastern Town Hall is spending and allocating funds will help us attract future funding. Help collaborators identify opportunities to work with us.
Help us scale and reach more people across the Eastern Hemisphere.
KPI measurement method and goals # A questionnaire on the number of proposers / voters / advisors is conducted for each fund in the community of the target country. The goal is to grow participation by 20% for each fund in the next 6 months. See our work on Catalyst Fund6 submission phase analysis[6] as a base line example.
Activities to reach KPIs # Daily: Inquiries from the community about Catalyst are answered by our members in their respective languages. We will translate Catalyst content and publish it via our website.
Weekly: We hold weekly planning events and meetups, sharing information about our activities with each community.
Monthly: Our spending is reported. We will manage your finances in a decentralized manner using a multi-sig wallet.
By Fund: Surveys will be conducted in each eastern community to count the number of voters, proposers and experts in each region.
Details and costs to implement # Budget Areas # Attendance at weekly project planning meetings that activate Eastern Hemisphere: 20 people x 2 hours x 4 weeks x 6 months x \$ 15: \$14,400 Financial management, progress management, monitoring and reporting activities, other new member recruiting activities, etc .: \$ 500 x 6 months = \$3,000 Common expenses: Expenses incurred across multiple projects (domain name, hosting costs, Zoom): \$1,000 Total: (1) ＋ (2) ＋ (3): \$18,400
▲ Discount: \$8,400
Billed: \$10,000
Further funding requirements in future funds will be required to maintain KPIs that support Cataslyt\u0026rsquo;s success in the Eastern hemisphere
We have already started this activity and will continue to do so whether or not this funding is raised.We gave a 45.6% discount to free up funds for a wider project.
NOTE: The funds directly required for each activity, such as East Asian entrepreneurial events in the Eastern Hemisphere, meetups, translation activities, theme setting and management, etc., are not in the category of funds required for this proposal.

Challenge question # What solutions can we build on Cardano to finance social and environmental innovation?
Why is it important? # To address the climate emergency and the associated economic challenges, we need to build resilient financial solutions for driving change.
How does success look like? # Impact investors, NGOs, and grassroots communities make Cardano the default choice to help transparently deliver the greatest impact.
Key Metrics to measure # At the end of this challenge, we will be asking ourselves some guiding questions about the quality of developed solutions:
Are we on track to improve the lives of people using them? How much financial capital is deployed to grassroots community efforts? How many gaps are filled along the impact investing value chain? Have we increased capital efficiency and lowered financing costs compared with current approaches? Are the solutions using Cardano\u0026rsquo;s technical features to the fullest? Do teams adopt high-assurance engineering practices to develop code we can trust? How decentralised is the solution and where are the points of control? At the moment there are very few usage metrics addressing Social \u0026amp; Environmental Finance (SoFi) scenarios. This challenge, therefore, will determine uptake by adopting some metrics from Decentralised Finance (DeFi) markets as a guide.
Daily/Monthly Active Wallets (DAW/MAW) - Measure of momentum and engagement Average Order Value - Measures who are using services, how much and how often. Total Value Locked (TLV) - Measure of confidence in DeFi market protocols. Take Rate (Rake) - Measure of efficiency Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) - Total value of services transacted. We will also be asking some specific questions about the proposals.
What is the sustainability of proposals beyond the scope of Catalyst? Was social and environmental impact evaluation used to measure proposal performance? Challenge brief # This challenge is about the ways we can spark a fire under impact investing using the Cardano ecosystem.
Impact investments are made with the intention to generate positive, measurable social and environmental impact alongside financial returns. While a variety of projects push for the adoption of DeFi on Cardano, can we bring to market the potential of DeFi mechanisms as a vehicle for social good?
Delivering an outcome that has an impact is a lot harder than just delivering a financial Return-on-Investment, even a small one. Impact investing (according to the World Economic Forum) is hindered by:
The lack and/or high cost of trustworthy data on the social or environmental results of investment, making credible accounting of impacts difficult. Challenges around the “attribution” of impact – meaning the allocation of an impact-related claim to an investor risks “double-counting.” Roadblocks in monetizing impacts – illiquid impact markets, uncertain returns, high transaction costs. Propose market solutions, financial mechanisms, or means of measuring impact. Think about how these can be deployed at scale to affect positively millions of people. Think about how the results of your proposal can be embedded or reused in different market contexts, or integrated with existing providers.
Igniting impact investment on Cardano will provide capital to address the world’s most pressing challenges in sectors such as sustainable agriculture, renewable energy, conservation, microfinance, and affordable and accessible basic services including housing, healthcare, and education.
To achieve impact requires cooperation and collaboration, something Cardano can enable. Could the answer to better managing the world’s resources lie not in government or big investors but instead in technologies that empower peer-to-peer assistance. Community-based finance or data-driven crowdfunding for instance. How can we leverage the awesome power of the Cardano ecosystem to be that catalyst?

Problem statement # There are no initiatives to attract and engage East Asian entrepreneurs where they are, in their local language.
Describe your solution to the problem # Use the Eastern Town Hall \u0026amp; targeted virtual events to establish and support a network of East Asian entrepreneurs.
Relevant experience # Co-Founders of Catalyst Swarm, Eastern Townhall, Catalyst School. IT \u0026amp; Software Engineering. Educators and accountant in East Asia \u0026amp; Japan.
Detailed plan # We want to reach the massive untapped potential of East Asian entrepreneurs. Meet them where they are, in their country, their language and their culture. The Eastern Townhall wants to establish a growing network of East Asian entrepreneurs. Where they can build knowledge, share information, connect and support each other. Thinking global, acting local.
Current Problems and Limitation # Recall a moment when you realised if you poked something, pushed it or moulded it, something new and interesting popped out the other side. We\u0026rsquo;re here again and this time on a global scale. We, the Cardano Catalyst community are pioneers in a new mindset. A new way of governing and funding. But to make a dent in the universe we need entrepreneurs. People are willing to take a risk, to poke, to push, and to mould new ways of doing.
Reaching Entrepreneurs is difficult when language and cultural barriers exist. Local context may also have undeveloped startup funding programmes too. This can result in unrealized startup funding opportunities. Few East Asian entrepreneurs are aware of the opportunities and the technical, economic benefits of Cardano; Nor is there a full understanding of how to apply Cardano technology within local communities to address local market opportunities. We want to change that.
Proposed Solution: Cardano StartUp Month # This proposal is about running virtual events in January/February 2022 to develop entrepreneurs in Vietnam and Indonesia. The event aims to upskill entrepreneurs to develop market opportunities based on Cardano.
The purpose of the event is to build startup founders and Distributed Autonomous Organisation (DAO) collaborators. We are not building startups! Our intent is to educate. Focusing on experience-based learning by providing a soft way for the general public to access entrepreneurship and blockchain technology without risk.
The event will happen over four weeks:
Virtual Networking (Week 1 \u0026amp; 2): The first two weeks of the event is about Networking. Getting registered participants to meet each other, discuss their ideas and aspirations. Tutorial sessions will be held to help upskill and familiarise people with business design tools.
Pitch and Team-Up (Start of Week 3): All participants come together for the opening event where individual participants can give a 60-second pitch of a project idea they want to pursue. People vote with their feet by choosing to join a team.
Learn and Work (Week 3 \u0026amp; 4): Over the next two weeks, teams start working together. Mentors are assigned. Special sessions are run with experts. Teams are encouraged to validate their ideas with potential customers. Throughout the two weeks, each team will have four 30min pitch sessions with a panel of mentors that help them refine their pitch and Catalyst Proposal.
Pitch (End of Week 4): All participants come together for the closing event. The pitch! Each team is given five minutes to present their market problem and their solution to a panellist that ask questions. To pitch every team must have submitted their proposal to Catalyst. When all presentations are given the audience will pick the winning teams. Prizes will be awarded. We all celebrate! At the conclusion of Fund 8, Catalyst Voters choose who to fund.
The event will focus on Cardano Blockchain solutions and place emphasis on using Business Model Generation, Customer Development approaches and the use of analytical tools like Lean Startup, the Platform Design Toolkit, and Wardley Mapping.
By the time proposals are submitted in Fund 8, entrepreneurial teams will have formed, worked together, finished customer testing, and developed robust business models.
What Success Looks Like # The event is planned to finish on conclusion of the second week of Catalyst fund 8, Feburary 2022. Teams will be submitting proposals to Catalyst Fund 8 as part of their work.
At the end of the event, at least 15 teams have managed to complete the process and submitted proposals to Catalyst Fund 8. Individuals complete the event with new skills, connections, and inspiration to continue their Cardano journey.
Key Performance Indicators # For Entrepreneurs Startup Month, participation:
Reaches 100 individuals that form into at least 20 teams. At least 15 teams submit proposals. At least 3 proposals that are funded in Catalyts Fund 8/9 At the end of the event:
We have increased our social media presense by 1000 followers. The event is covered by four major media outlets. After One Month: # Event Team formed, project plans and budgets finalised.

Problem statement # There are barriers, such as a lack of trusted information to voting caused by language differences \u0026amp; cultural exclusivity.
Describe your solution to the problem # Provide trusted information by meeting people where they are, in their local language and culture.
Relevant experience # Co-Founders of Catalyst Swarm, Eastern Townhall, Catalyst School. IT \u0026amp; Software Engineering. educators and accountant in East Asia \u0026amp; Japan.
Detailed plan # Voting on how Catalyst spends the treasury creates long-term value to ADA, but with so many proposals, with so many new concepts, how do we make any voting decision? Now imagine how difficult it must be when you do not speak English. All Ada holders benefit if we develop better more inclusive and diverse governance processes and strategies. Unless the Catalyst Community and Ada holders level up our collective cognition, a random voting strategy is just as valid as a well researched one.
Current Problems and Limitation # Language differences and cultural exclusivity prevents governance initiatives from scaling globally. The constant experimentation of Catalyst means we need to be mindful to include different languages and cultures. Avoiding one culture dominating the narrative.
Misaligned incentives, scams and information overload prevent Ada holders from voting. In Asia and other non-native English speaking cultures, language barriers compound this. Language barriers are evident at every Catalyst stage. Survey results showed in the Japanese community biggest problem of Catalyst voting was the lack of Japanese support (45.61%). Over %37 of respondents highlighted issues with understanding the process- \u0026ldquo;I didn\u0026rsquo;t understand the meaning because it was in English, so I voted randomly\u0026rdquo;. The weariness of scams and lack of trust between proposals and voters were highlighted too. Another %16 mentioned incentive misalignment issues.
Our solution: Eastern Townhall Goverance Forum # Our goal is to establish a process, format, and event stage for voter and proposer onboarding. To bring voters, proposers, and proposals closer together. To establish trust between them. The focus is on six mutually reinforcing areas:
Content production: Help Ada holders understanding why it is important to vote on proposals. Eastern Hemisphere Language-specific events focused on voter education and discussion. A proposal language translation pipeline to help proposers reach the wider East Asian community. Language-specific Catalyst Swarm Ideafests as a stage for building voter awareness, engagement, and trust. Social Media Marketing: socialise voter content and messaging across our social media channels; and Conduct routine surveys and user research to help understand individual attitudes to Catalyst and proposal formats. The proposal is seeking funds to help develop a programme specifically designed to help connect voters with proposals and proposers.
Together these activities form a programme we call the Eastern Townhall Forum. Our cornerstone event is the weekly Eastern Townhalls. But we are doing more. We are doing translations, building community, sharing knowledge, educating, enabling entrepreneurs, and growing Cardano.
The Eastern Townhall trusted seed are an active part of our Cardano ecosystem. Listening and engaging with members of the community. Sharing what we learn. For instance Yuta Yuta recently completed one of his many surveys of the Japanese community[1] that this proposal draws upon. We want to do more of this across all the communities. We would like to help improve the user experience for voters. Feeding our collective insights back into Project Catalyst.
Help us improve decision making across the Eastern Hemisphere by making Catalyst voting more accessible.
What Success Looks Like # Participation in Eastern Townhall events has increased and maintains the vibrancy of the new and regular community members. More Catalyst proposers engage with the Asian community. Even if that is just translation of proposals, content, or DApps for the Asian markets. Additionally, Asian proposers find their crowd. They are able to be funded because there is a strong body of Asian voters participating in Catalyst. Survey results show an increase in voter engagement with proposers, the Catalyst process, and deliberations before voting.
Key Performance Indicators # Our primary tool for measuring performance is our voter survey. We will conduct these on a regular basis across Asian countries. Based on the surveys during and after a fund we expect to:
Increase Asian voter participation by 30% from the previous funds. Increase Asian participation in Catalyst by 20% from the previous fund. Uncertainty around Catalyst and voting decreases 25% from the previous fund. The Eastern Townhall Meetup is our primary stage where Ada holders and people interested in Cardano can come and meet community members. Through that platform and social media, people learn and feel comfortable going further. Therefore key engagement metrics indicate our success in bridging voters and proposers together:
The Easter Townhall meetup average weekly numbers increase 25% for each fund. Catalyst Proposals available in four languages (ID, JP, KR, VN) increase 50% for each fund. Eastern Townhall Social Media accounts increase followers by 1000 new followers in six months. After One Month: # Completed our first pan-Asia voter survey across four Asian countries (ID, JP, KR, VN) Language-Specific events – Voter Education \u0026amp; Catalyst Swarm After Three Months: # Produced our Voter Education videos Translated Catalyst voter materials in four Asian languages (ID, JP, KR, VN) Held the first formal language specific Eastern Townhall - Catalyst Swarm IdeaFests. (A test run for Fund 6 is being done to find our feet). After Six Months: # Completed six voter surveys across four Asian countries (ID, JP, KR, VN) Completed a retrospective on our activities. After Twelve Months: # We have incorporated the content and practices need to engage with Asian voters and proposers. Our monthly surveys continue and show forward momentum. Our content continues to engage members of the community We have translated our content and Catalyst material to more languages across Asia.

Problem statement # Despite a population of billions, East Asians are underrepresented in Catalyst due to a lack of localised content.
Describe your solution to the problem # Setup a translation pipeline that will translate catalyst documentation \u0026amp; proposals across as many languages in East Asia as possible.
Relevant experience # Co-Founders of Catalyst Swarm, Eastern Townhall, Catalyst School. IT \u0026amp; Software Engineering. educators and accountant in East Asia \u0026amp; Japan.
Detailed plan # East Asia and Southeast Asia region unites culturally and linguistically diverse countries. People in these communities are excited about getting involved in the Cardano ecosystem. Despite having a population of 1.6 Billion, Catalyst has seen very few proposals from East Asia and Southeast Asian regions.
Current Problems and Limitation # Across East Asia and Southeast Asian regions, English is not routinely spoken and a web of regional languages are used [1].
Language barriers reduce participation in Catalyst. It limits the potential growth of Cardano adoption and utility in this region. We experience this, we hear this from our communities. We know Cardano is missing our stories, our energy, and our perspectives of how to use Cardano to increase economic wellbeing.
Proposed Solution: Translation Pipeline and Automation # Our objective is to build and document a streamlined process for content translation and start the development of localised content. We have already set up a simple translation pipeline[2] using Git, Hugo, and Github Actions. We\u0026rsquo;ve tested several translation services such as Crowdin[3], Lokalize[4], PoEditor[5], and GitLozalise[6] for the Eastern Townhall to help us organise and gain some experience.
Our initial objective is simple: to get a lot of existing Cardano and Catalyst material translated into as many languages of the East and Southeast Asian regions using a semi-automated system. Gaining experience and building community. Documenting what we do and how.
By semi-automated system, we do not mean machine translation. While Machine translation is helpful as a starting point, it has difficulty with specialised terms and does not read naturally. Human translations will always have a slight advantage. A semi-automated system refers to an ability to queue a piece of work for translation, which may include feeding it through a machine translation service, have it worked on by someone, reviewed, and then published.
We will start to embrace and extend the excellent localisation documentation processes established by Kubernetes SIG Docs group[7] to help us. Adapting the processes to accommodate the varying technical skills and future directions we want to take.
Work Streams # To establish a functioning and sustainable translation pipeline, we are seeking initial funding to help develop the work we have already started. The funding will cover five workstreams:
Evaluation of translation services and their integration: with Git, Github, Ideascale, and the Markdown-based documentation efforts of the Cardano Foundation. Design, configuration, testing of a translation pipeline: The goal is to have a small scale process in place that is easy enough to follow and requires minimal supervision. Documenting translation process \u0026amp; development of tutorial material: Embrace and extend the Kubernettes SIG Doc[7] processes to help with our own needs. Developing localised tutorial content to onboard future translators. Train the trainers: Run training sessions with Eastern Townhall members to a level of competence in the process such that they can train others. Translations: Getting up to speed on our workflow is going to require some hands-on tinkering and experience. We aim to translate a selection of Catalyst Guides, Community Advisor, voter education and our own material. That takes time and effort for each language. Getting Scale: Earn-to-Learn # To get true scale, translations and localisation standards, automation, and skills need to be developed so we can outsource localisation to the wider Cardano community. Doing translation and localisation work as a way to get more involved in Cardano and the different communities. Doing translation and localisation work; learning and earning. Doing translation and localisation work to build a reputation and earn Ada. We see a future that leverages Metadata, Native Assets, Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT), Machine-Learning, and Atala Prism on the Cardano blockchain to give us language and cultural reach. However, starting simply first.
Collaboration # Translation and localisation of content is a general issue across many groups working in Cardano and Catalyst. We do not plan to do this work alone or exclusively. In the Eastern Town Hall, we are at the forefront of managing many languages and cultures, our plan is to develop practices and automated processes for our own purposes, and share them widely. Everything we learn and do, we hope will inform the Cardano ecosystem at large.
What Success Looks Like # Near-term the Eastern Townhall is able to translate and host Catalyst Proposals as they are finalised. Translated for our four initial languages in the Asian region. Funded project reports are integrated and translated too. We have also translated, and maintain those translations, of key Cardano and Catalyst documents and guides.
Mid-term we would like to expand the languages translated, and we are actively working with other groups across the Cardano Ecosystem to do this work.
Longer-term success means we\u0026rsquo;ve established a whole decentralised workflow for translation and interpretation of any document, video, podcast etc. using the Cardano Network as the coordinating backbone. Where one of the simplest ways to onboard and earn ADA in the Cardano ecosystem system is to help translate, transcribe or interpret material (no harm in dreaming big!).
Key Performance Indicators # Since we are using Git, and Github for the Eastern Townhall planning, organisation, documentation, metrics are derived from Github activity and engagement.
Key Metric: Project Velocity[8], defined as a combination of base activity metric of commits and pull-requests taken from Github.
Activity Metrics: captured as project activity in Github and cadence documents added and the speed of translation.
Community Metrics: engagement behaviours broken down into four categories[9] for the Eastern Townhall website, to measure how our work is being spread and used in the Cardano ecosystem.
After One Month: # Eastern Townhall website information architecture has been developed. Primary content for the initial website has been identified and ported to Markdown. The entire Eastern Townhall website is translated. After Three Months: # We have established a semi-automated translation pipeline driven by Git Pull requests. Evaluated and tested different translations services as a means to simplify translation. Documented our initial translation process and trained the trainers. Expanded formats for translations to include video subtitles. Issuing NFTs for skills, language, and attribution/contribution tracking. After Six Months: # On-boarding more members of the Cardano Community to do translations. Added two more Eastern hemisphere languages to our core set. Tutorial material (documentation and videos) is developed and translated to help onboard new contributors and languages. After Twelve Months: # All Catalyst Proposals and Funded Projects are translated and published within days of being produced. We have expanded our core language set to include the ten languages from the Eastern hemisphere. The translation project is self-sustaining because projects/teams/businesses want to reach our audience in their native language. The Cardano ecosystem coalesce around similar standards for document management and their translations.

Budget # The requested Fund 6 budget is for wages for three months and six months of expenses. Fifty per cent of funds will be used retrospectively to cover work and expenses we are already undertaking.
Evaluation/Integration of Translation services: \$1200 USD Workflow Automation: \$3000 USD Process Documentation: \$2200 USD Train the Trainers: \$850 USD Translations: \$1250 USD Project Management (%8): \$1000 USD Software Services \u0026amp; Servers: \$3000 USD Software Services \u0026amp; Servers fees (\$500 x 6 months = \$3,000) includes the expenses of using a translation service (anywhere from \$140USD to \$240USD a month) to help streamline translations; Github; website hosting and any servers needed for translation.
This funding only concerns setting up and testing a translation pipeline. Further funds will be requested to continue any work beyond the three month period, either through Catalyst or other means of funding the Eastern Townhall activity.

Campaign Brief # Propose a means or way to drive mass-scale adoption of DID usage as an easy-to-use onramp to the Cardano ecosystem (preferably Atala PRISM when released). This can include any method that will offer users or entities a decentralized ID to start defining their digital self-sovereignty. Think about how this is implemented at scale drawing millions of users, who, once onboard, can become customers for dApps, tools, DeFi and other services.
We are a community of thought leaders and it is time to demonstrate our thoughts with actions. Using a Decentralized Identification (DID) technology to establish self-sovereign presence and ownership of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) advances decentralization of institutions; benefiting individuals and entities.
This Challenge is about small ways we can incorporate DIDs into the Cardano ecosystem to start the ground swell at the grassroots that demands PII be secured and controlled with DID technologies and standards.
It is about signaling to the world that the Cardano community plans mass-adoption of DID that is interchangeable, interoperable (by WW DID standards) and we care deeply that the origin of our personal DID is tied to our home blockchain—Cardano.
While we prefer to support Atala PRISM\u0026rsquo;s instantiation of DID, this is more about building ideas and concepts that require DID to draw users to the Cardano platform. And since PRISM is building to the open standards, those are available for anyone to imagine possibilities and offer proposals.
It won\u0026rsquo;t be lost on IOHK how the community responses to this Challenge. Should IOHK see a ground swell of great ideas and proposals, that could help them justify expediting timelines for their planned open sourcing of PRISM components.
Why is it important? # Atala PRISM DID is a gateway to the Cardano blockchain and ecosystem. Building technology and marketecture that on-boards users is crucial.
How does success look like? # Many high quality ideas will be proposed that can substantially grow Cardano\u0026rsquo;s user-base, network-utility, network-value \u0026amp; ADA circulation.
Key Metrics to measure # The number of proposals that directly address DID use cases in a quantifiable manner. The quality of proposals measured by community interest and engagement.

Campaign Brief # Startup innovation and co-creation is the lifeblood of Cardano. Many early stage ventures are now launching into the Cardano ecosystem and Catalyst wants to fuel many pioneering successes.
More needs to be done to accelerate best of breed Catalyst-funded projects by providing pathways into professional business support, investment, and mentoring programmes.
This is important to Catalyst because great ideas need to be nurtured and small teams need access to timely expertise and tools beyond those that they have in-house.
This challenge seeks professional-grade Accelerator programmes and Business Incubators to step up, co-develop, and deliver venture building programmes with Catalyst. The objective is to help catalyse early successes of Catalyst-funded projects and turn them into highly investable ventures. This helps projects funded by the community to get a fast track to resources and expertise that will help teams build invaluable know-how and strategy by plugging gaps in their current capabilities.
Key to this challenge is the alignment of the proposal to the challenge? And how will success be measured during the scope of the project and beyond?
Proposers should give strong consideration to providing evidence of their experience and history of success and also provide Catalyst voters and reviewers supporting information about the project\u0026rsquo;s operational approach to delivering the objectives previously stated. The more detail the better.
We anticipate that a number of proposals that address this challenge will be funded in Fund 7 and we hope the community takes a portfolio approach to select projects from different parts of the world or a variety of themes relevant to the adoption of Cardano-based projects and the Cardano ecosystem as a whole.
Why is it Important? # Knowledge is power and enabling project\u0026rsquo;s to tap into to a distributed network of professional mentors and supporters will enable ventures to grow stronger and faster. Catalyst wants organizations and groups who have a track record of business incubation and acceleration to apply.

Campaign page and browse ideas
Campaign Brief # COTI has developed, together with a very productive and successful partnership with Cardano, a very user-friendly and scalable ADA payment solution for the community. As a result, different online merchants, from a small hotel in Europe to a big e-commerce website in Asia, can easily accept hundreds or thousands of ADA transactions when integrating ADA Pay into their site.
With Catalyst, we are offering an innovative technical challenge to our communities to allow a new and creative way for all small and medium enterprises currently using platforms, such as Shopify and WooCommerce, to readily accept ADA Payments with seamless integration by adding a plug-in into their site.
In a nutshell, ADA Pay currently provides the ability to send a separate payment request to each payment attempt, allowing merchants to effectively identify each client without requiring the customer\u0026rsquo;s identity before completing the order. In other words, companies integrating ADA Pay enjoy the ability to send a unique address to a potential customer and be notified at every stage of the payment process via Webhook. Moreover, by registering the payment request on the client\u0026rsquo;s backend, merchants can know who pays for what without disclosing the client\u0026rsquo;s information to a third party.
The teams proceeding with the challenge will be provided with an API Key to the ADA Pay system and complete API documentation of the payment solution. The API Key will allow you to receive and send payments with ADA over the Cardano testnet. The API documentation also includes endpoints to create payment requests, withdraw your funds, and a webhook to notify you of any ongoing activity regarding the payment request.
With the tools described above, we expect from the teams involved in the challenge to create an innovative plug-in that will be integrated with our current ADA Pay system on the one hand and support all the different e-commerce software mentioned above (Shopify and WooCommerce) on the other.
How does success look like? # At the end of this challenge, we will be asking ourselves: Do we have a simple, flawless, and easy-to-integrate ADA Pay plug-in solution ready to be integrated into different e-commerce platforms?
Is the UI and payment flow of the plug-in user-friendly? For example, is the process smooth from when customers add items into their cart until the transaction is complete?
Be creative; the fewer clicks needed to complete a transaction, the better.
Key Metrics to measure # Total amount of e-commerce platforms that can be integrated into the new component. Ratio of total transaction attempts and transactions completed, measuring the effectiveness of the payment flow proposed. Scalability of the plug-in without compromising the quality of the service. Number of merchants that can be integrated with the plug-in. Guiding Questions: # We would like you to consider the following and provide rationales about the planned approach in your proposals.
How will you test the plug-in\u0026rsquo;s quality, and how easy is it to implement it into the software platforms? Is the plug-in able to process big amounts of transactions per second from different websites without problems? How do you intend to design for the user\u0026rsquo;s needs and incorporate Merchant\u0026rsquo;s feedback regarding the plug-in performance? Funding Parameters # COTI are providing the funding for all challenge rewards.
Proposers: Successful proposers will be funded in COTI token. Please be aware that you are responsible for providing a valid ERC20 address that can receive COTI tokens. When applying, please specify in the address field of the proposal submission your ERC20 compatible address.
Community advisors: You will receive COTI for the eligible VCA and CA rewards and will be sent to your nominated ERC20 wallet address.
Referrers: You will receive COTI for the eligible referral rewards that will be sent to your nominated ERC20 wallet address. 1% of the COTI challenge fund will be shared between eligible referrers.

Campaign Brief # Our challenge is an evolution of the mass decentralized identity (DID) adoption challenge from Funding Round 6, connecting everything we are learning with the first Atala PRISM Pioneer Program cohort.
The second cohort of the Atala PRISM Pioneer Program will kick off once Catalyst Fund 7 is complete. Between now and then, any member of the Catalyst Community inspired to write a proposal will get access to the Atala PRISM Pioneer Program first cohort course materials on Canvas. Please submit your proposal on Ideascale, including your email address, to get an invitation to Canvas.
With this access, you\u0026rsquo;ll join the growing Atala PRISM community. Our Atala PRISM product team and engineers will be available via a dedicated Discord channel. Inclusion in our Professional Services Group governance framework foundry. Access to fireside chats with the top leaders in the SSI space, where we\u0026rsquo;ll discuss trends, use cases, and much more. In addition, we will support the growth of high-value credentials and enable partners from concept, to development, to commercialization.
Areas of focus # Interoperability # Most digital credentials sit on Hyperledger Indy ledgers, including those issued by governments in Germany, Canada, and the UK.
The best-performing platform will gain the largest market share. For many reasons, we believe our platform is superior. Therefore, Cardano and Atala PRISM must include a plan to interact with these other ecosystems to maximize market share.
We encourage Catalyst proposals to achieve full interoperability. Deliverables should optimize the user experience (UX) for Atala PRISM credentials while remaining compatible with other platforms.
Self-governance of Emergent Communities # DAO Governance in Practice # New legislation in Wyoming allows for a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) to be registered with the state. We challenge the community to establish a DAO under the new laws. It could manage an impact or development goal with shared common resources governed by the DAO.
We are curious to see if our community proposes a DAO. With a funded proposal, we could facilitate introductions to legal experts in Wyoming.
The proposal should consider setting aside funds for legal expenses to establish the DAO and legal documentation.
Patterns of Commoning # We draw inspiration from the work of the Trust Over IP Foundation and the principles from \u0026lsquo;Patterns of Commoning.\u0026rsquo; We see the potential for innovation by linking communities with shared interests under these principles.
How can these principles become plug-and-play code as technological primitives that other communities can leverage and unlock exponential growth and adoption?
We are interested in exploring a rich playground of ideas and bringing these to real-world implementations on Cardano and Atala PRISM.
Education, Career, and Emergent Reputation Primitives # Many of our Pioneer and Catalyst-funded projects support education and career programs. One of the defining characteristics of these approaches is the creation of alternatives to accredited education and career paths.
We need our community to think about developing technology and governance primitives to support any community that wants to establish new education and career paths by providing tools:
For onboarding new experts and teachers For people in the community to develop and grow For maintaining a reputation as a skilled employee, laborer, consultant, mentor, teacher, etc. When reputation standards change, we need ways to self-heal and self-monitor for bad actors, harmful actions, or bad outcomes.
Circular Supply Chain # The global supply chain focuses on creating a new economic infrastructure. The goal is replacing or integrating with legacy systems such as record-keeping, bills of lading, centrally managed systems of record, and distribution networks. Centralization has many challenges, the least of which is a lack of resilience in the global supply chain, as we have all seen and continue to experience in the COVID era.
Supply chains tend to start as decentralized. Markets and trade routes emerge from the bottom of the producer market and are aggregated into centralized supply chains, eventually working their way down to the consumer. We want to explore new patterns of commerce in bottom-up supply chains that could open and expand the local reputation network into markets that are currently inaccessible, such as:
Regenerative agriculture Locally produced art Other forms of local commerce On the other side, distribution or demand-driven commerce has the potential to build a market force from the bottom-up that can engage the industrial global supply chain in ways that are not possible without establishing the voice and economic strength of the community digitally.
For the supply chain challenge, we want to address two significant challenges:
Small Producer Problem # How can we create transparency as the bottom-up process meets the industrialized supply chains, cuts through the centralized distribution markets, and connects directly to the consumer?
For example, small producers like a family ranch in Wyoming have no way to get information about the value of their product through these global aggregation and distribution networks. Currently, a solution such as the BeefChain project is supporting small ranchers.
There are multiple issues to overcome. For example, packaging plants are the entry point to the aggregation, so there is little or no incentive to deal with the small producer. We want to address this problem by building general-purpose tooling to assist communities in self-organizing and self-governing production according to agreed standards. We propose that if these communities can connect and grow, they will either:
Reach the market through alternative distribution channels to industrial supply chains Be able to negotiate as a community for better terms to have the values of their products recognized, distributed, and sold with value intact commercially and reputationally.
The Last-Mile Problem # How can a local distributor in a local market interact with global industrial supply chains and be given access to the market that otherwise would be inaccessible due to a lack of economic identity or capital to access the goods at the scale required by industrial supply chains?
This challenge deals with distributing necessary products to local communities with little market clout or access to financial tools, such as credit, to interact with the industrial supply chain. We\u0026rsquo;re looking for bottom-up tooling to establish a network of communities. Delegates in those communities can access the finance and credit necessary to interact with the industrial supply chain at the economic scale required for transactions.
An example of this problem is delivering health care supplies to rural and developing countries and economies. The funds from donors, the government, and other sources are available for these medical supplies. The donors will only release the funds once delivery is verified, and the medical supply companies will only send the goods to port once payment is received.
However, local small businesses must maintain transparency and oversight of the goods during delivery and receiving. These businesses do not have the funds or the ability to borrow capital to cover medical supplies costs from the delivery at the port to the hospitals and clinics that need them.
Addressing the challenge of the financial gap is vital. We believe that there is enormous potential to create bottom-up networks of trusted individuals and small businesses to fill this gap.
Why is it Important? # How individuals interact with their communities and the broader economy helps us understand which credentials improve their daily lives. By identifying these high-value, high-impact credentials, we can establish governance framework foundries for launching pilot programs and driving growth. Ultimately, this will cause further adoption of Cardano and Atala PRISM technology.
How does success look like? # Discover repeatable patterns that unlock our ability to leverage the Cardano decentralized infrastructure. Identify high-value credentials and use cases. Once identified, we can form stakeholder governance framework working groups. These groups will allow us to foster the development of community, partner, and vendor ecosystems to launch into commercial and production environments.

Campaign Brief # The previous challenge(ScaleUP Cardano\u0026rsquo;s DeFi Ecosystem) demonstrated success and allowed popular DeFi projects such as Liqwid Finance, Minswap and ErgoDEX to be funded by the treasury, without the participation of venture capitals and with fair launch models, allowing sustainable distribution of the supply among the community/userbase.
The fact that ERGODEX\u0026rsquo;s proposal was the second best voted proposal in the Left-Over budget is an important indicator to demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposals presented in Fund5.
Currently, the vast majority of DeFi dapps and assets flows occur on the Ethereum blockchain, however due to congestion and increased transaction fees, the use of DeFi is increasingly elitized, leaving out the people who could most benefit from it, the unbanked.
Over the past year several DeFi projects have been moving to more scalable blockchains, such as Binance Smart Chain, Polkadot, Cosmos, Solana, among others. Second layer solutions are also being used as alternatives to Ethereum main chain, Polygon has been a great example.
In this migration and bridges creation scenario, some projects are turning to Cardano to create their DeFi projects.
Cardano is finally delivering smart contracts and that opens a door to a lot of innovation in DeFi. We can offer not only a scalable blockchain, but also a secure blockchain and aggregated governance layer in the near future. This set of characteristics place Cardano in a prominent place and with a good opportunity to gain market share and expand the user base.
With Catalyst, we have the opportunity to fund DeFi projects and allow them to have greater decentralization and resilience, which are essential aspects for DeFi projects. Many projects end up accepting the participation of Venture Capitals due to lack of financial resources. The participation of VCs in DeFi projects usually ends up causing a large part of the supply distribution to be alocated to VCs and this compromises the decentralization and consequently the security of these projects.
The DeFi ecosystem today is taken over by projects full of vulnerabilities, hacks are constant, economic models are copied from other projects, decentralization is no longer a priority and few projects are dedicated to create economic models/bonding curves/algorithms thinking about the users\u0026rsquo; needs.
It has become clear over the year that bugs, hacks and vulnerabilities are not unique to smart contracts on Ethereum. Dapps running on Binance Smart Chain and Cosmos suffered from vulnerabilities as well.
Hackers stole at least \$600M in Poly exploit across three chains Thorchain suffers \$5 million exploit, developers have put out a fix
Cardano arrives to change this paradigm and bring security to users.
Privacy and resistance to censorship are also important but often overlooked in favor of subsidizing (yield farming). How to encourage DeFi projects to seek resilience, safety, research-based economic models and critical thinking?
Potential Directions # DEXs Oracles Algorithmic stable coins Borrowing/Lending dapps Derivatives Research for open source new financial models (bonding curves) Rational For Budget Distrobution # To encourage greater diversity of funded teams and proposals each team can request up to 20% of the total \$500,000 USD budget or \$100,000 USD.
E.g. - Team A with 2 proposals of \$50,000 USD - Team B with 1 proposal of \$100,000 USD - Team C with 1 proposal of \$80,000 USD + 1 proposal of \$20,000 US
Why is it Important? # It\u0026rsquo;s important because Defi dApps provide trustless on-demand access to financial services for global users
How does success look like? # A competitive environment for DeFi on Cardano with an emphasis on cross-collaboration \u0026amp; driving composability across protocols.
Key Metrics to measure # How many DeFi dapps were launched on Cardano mainnet within 3, 6 and 12 months after funding. How long does each dapp take to be launched. How many daily active users are the DeFi dapps funded in this cohort attracting. How much Total Value Locked (TVL) are the funded DeFi dapps able to capture 3, 6 and 12 months after launch. Number of bugs and vulnerabilities found in each dapp. Amount of resources lost due to bugs or vulnerabilities. Number of users participating in testnets. Number of token holders/unique wallets(when dapp has a token). Distribution of supply between the team and the community. Numbers of listed pairs (in case of DEXs). Number of listed assets (cases of loan+lending dapps, derivatives and synthetic assets). Number of articles and open source financial models research delivered to the community. `}),e.add({id:34,href:"/catalyst/fund9/challenges/building-on-blockfrost/campaign-brief/",title:"Building on Blockfrost ",description:"How can we expand the Blockfrost ecosystem to drive the developer adoption on Cardano?",content:` Fund Size: 50,000 USD paid in Ada

Challenge Brief # Blockfrost is an instant, public and freely accessible API that removes infrastructure obstacles for developers so that everyone can start building (d)apps on Cardano. With Blockfrost, developers can start doing what they love ❤️, without the need for running and maintaining additional infrastructure and tooling themselves. At the moment, we have more than 10,000 developers already onboarded in our Blockfrost.io hosted platform.
We are also working on open-sourcing Blockfrost API backend, making it possible for the community to further build and provide the service.
This challenge is set to create a thriving developer ecosystem around Blockfrost, encouraging not only more developers to build on Blockfrost but also build the Blockfrost ecosystem as well.
Guiding Questions # How can we drive new developers to Cardano with Blockfrost? Can we acquire already existing developers from the Crypto space? How can we make Blockfrost more decentralized and robust? Can we provide guidance to existing developers on how to build more secure applications on Cardano? Possible Directions # Development of new frameworks Research of new concepts Educational material Contributing to blockfrost.dev documentation portal Blog posts, articles and tutorials SDKs for NFT minting and NFT management Dashboard and UI alternatives Auditing of existing code base Incentive schemes for developers and providers Collaboration to improve interoperability within existing tools in the ecosystem Hackathons Open-source solutions are strongly preferred.
The Blockfrost team will provide technical support and guidance as well as free developer subscriptions to all winners of this challenge.
Why is it important? # It is important to create a thriving developer ecosystem around critical infrastructure components such as Blockfrost.
What does success look like? # Different open-source initiatives building an active ecosystem around Blockfrost, from tooling to frameworks.

Spot solutions for e.g. traceability, supply chain management, identification and payments have been implemented but large scale benefits of this promising technology are yet to be seen. Based on years of rigorous research and development, Cardano is one of the most serious contenders to fulfill this promise.
Recent and upcoming technological developments in Cardano—smart contracts, Yoroi dApp connector, larger block size (higher throughput), sidechains and state channels, to name a few—are gearing Cardano to be ready for large scale adoption in 2022.
Large corporations, small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs), platform businesses and highly networked startups have very different types of needs. Their industries may vary from finance and high-tech to agriculture and construction and from simple services to knowledge-intensive business. Yet, at the end of the day, they all need modern tools to keep fulfilling their mission, to remain relevant in global competition and to offer their employees the best tools to do what they were hired to do. Any company wants to engage their partners and employees, serve their customers better, improve their processes, cut costs, increase revenues and expand to new business areas.
By removing the middle man and automating processes, smart contract blockchain solutions can drive all of the above. Cardano can at least partly answer to these needs.
In this challenge, proposed solutions can be tools, services, products, process improvements, data management solutions (CRM, ERP, MES, DMP etc), decentralized cloud solutions, privacy and security related offerings or even metaverse-related solutions.
In your proposal, it would be good to outline the extent, limits and scope of the solution readiness-level of the solution, and whether it is e.g:
A Feasibility Study, Proof-of-Concept, Minimum Viable Product that could be built on Cardano. An existing business-ready product or service that could be converted to run on Cardano. A business-oriented training or consultancy service. An existing blockchain solution brought into the Cardano ecosystem to serve business needs. A prototype or demo in operational environment A creation of model of a system or subsystem A process improvement When submitting proposals, please include the long-term vision, strategy and roadmap as well as short-term deliverables attainable in the next 6-9 months. Visualization and video materials are more than welcome to explain often complex business solutions.

Campaign Brief # What research and scaling implementations can be introduced to help Cardano increase scalability?
Why is it important? # Hydra will not solve every scaling problem in Cardano, more scaling solutions are needed as alternatives.
What does success look like? # Scaling solutions that are introduced and implemented by the community that Cardano projects can start using.
Key Metrics to measure # Number of scaling solutions available to the community to use within their projects Number of projects launched on any of the new scaling solutions Novel ideas generated from research on different scaling approaches Challenge Brief # For Cardano to become a global leader as a smart contract blockchain it will need to scale to meet the requirements of handling hundreds of millions of users.
Current Scaling Situation # Hydra is the leading project being executed by IOG to help Cardano scale the blockchain.
The first phase of Hydra will be available in 2022 however this initial implementation will not resolve all of the problems needed for Cardano to scale.
Sebastien from dcSpark recently discussed the importance of rollups and alternative solutions in an interview -
Need for more scaling options # To reach true decentralization the Cardano community will need to not rely on the input from IOG as much as it does now as we move into the future.
Hydra will only have it\u0026rsquo;s initial implementation released early next year. Cardano faces potential scaling problems in 2022 as high demand protocols in DeFi, NFTs and gaming begin and continue being released. With alternative scaling solutions not in place there is a risk of overloading demand on the main chain.
Types of proposals encouraged # Proposers should consider new novel ideas or research, extensions of Hydra functionality or porting over solutions used in other blockchains that would be suitable for Cardano.
Proposers are welcome to focus on market specific scalability solutions - for instance a solution could focus on DeFi specifically with decentralized exchanges (DEX\u0026rsquo;s) as a focus area or other growing markets that could benefit from novel scaling solutions.
Scalability topic areas:
Rollups (e.g. zero knowledge rollups, optimistic rollups) Sharding Sidechains State channels Size of Proposals # Scaling solutions are inherently complex and require significant engineering effort. As a result proposers should not be discouraged from making proposals that request most of the challenge budget. A single proposal team is both welcome and encouraged to request the entire budget if they can demonstrate an articulated plan with the technical expertise to address the challenge of scaling solutions that are suitable for growing Cardano.
Budget rationale # High technical expertise is needed for scalability solutions. Projects will likely take many months of engineering effort to implement viable solutions.
Follow on funding rounds # If this this challenge setting gets voted in and the proposal(s) submitted show signs they can be impactful then a follow on challenge will be submitted for fund 9 with a larger requested budget to further help the team(s) be able to request further funding.

Campaign Brief # Increasing the speed of funding is critically important to allow important projects to move rapidly from volunteers to paid professionals. While volunteerism is strong in our community (and a strength), the ability to pay people for their time will accelerate and dramatically improve the time and energy people will be able to devote to Catalyst.
We need to explore alternative ways of scaling how we fairly distribute the treasury to grow the Cardano ecosystem. We should be willing to experiment and try different models in parallel and compare and contrast them. Paramount to our success is scaling how our community functions and decides on fair and just allocation of our treasury, measuring its impact, and continuously evolving and improving.
Why is it Important? # Catalyst relies on continuous work by the community to progress and grow, rapid funding can support a wider array of work and personal needs
How does success look like? # Implemented rapid Catalyst funding mechanisms that provide sustainable economic value to proposers within Project Catalyst guidelines.
Key Metrics to measure # Are submitted solutions of funding mechanisms faster than Catalyst? How Scalable is this proposal? How would it scale to 10x? 100x? 1000x? More? How Transparent is this proposal? Is it open, auditable, and enables transparency of decisions, funding, and results? How Accountable is this proposal? What is the reporting requirement? Are funds disbursed over time based on performance? How impactful is this proposal? Are disbursed funds creating net positive results? Does this proposal see a greater return on intent compared to Catalyst? `}),e.add({id:39,href:"/docs/catalyst-guide/",title:"Catalyst Docs",description:"Catalyst Docs",content:""}),e.add({id:40,href:"/catalyst/fund9/challenges/challenge-scouted-for-students/campaign-brief/",title:"Challenge \u0026 Scouted for Students 🎓",description:"How can we provide Student Entrepreneurs with a place to appeal their ideas to the world and an opportunity to connect with Engineers?",content:` Fund Size: 100,000 USD paid in Ada
Campaign page
Challenge Brief # Student entrepreneurs have exciting business ideas and motivations to start a business, but they lack the resources to implement them. In particular, the shortage of development funds and engineers is serious, and students have few opportunities to get these resources. However, Catalysts are easier to raise money than VCs(Venture Capital) and Business Contests, and also can connect globally with engineers in this community. However, the number of proposals to Catalysts is increasing rapidly, and the community does not easily notice small-scale proposals from students. In addition, it is difficult to set a clear Roadmap while resources are scarce and to get a high evaluation from CA(Community Advisor).
Therefore, to make it easier for the community to recognize new ideas from students, we will establish a new Category exclusively for students. In addition, instead of the roadmap being ambiguous, we set a budget limit of \$ 5,000. By doing so, many students can experience funding from Catalyst. In continued participation in Catalyst, funding experience, even on a small scale, is evaluated by the community. Therefore, it is important to set a budget limit.
The Category Goal is to encourage engineers to scout students who are evaluated by the community and create a new team to join the next Fund with a clear Roadmap. This is a benefit for both students and engineers to raise a large salary for engineers through Catalyst rather than from VCs or Banks.
Why is it important? # Most student entrepreneurs are suffering from resource shortages, especially in funding and engineer recruitment.
What does success look like? # By setting up a student category and increasing the exposure of their ideas, they can expect easier funding and scouted from engineers.
Key Metrics to measure # Number of proposals for this category Number of applause and comments from the community Number of proposals that could be collaborated with other engineers Number of proposals that participated in the next fund `}),e.add({id:41,href:"/docs/catalyst-guide/guides/",title:"Challenge and Proposal Guide",description:"What does your user need to understand about Project Catalyst in order to submit a proposal, be a community advisor, or voting?",content:`Project Catalyst is underway and we’re seeing some incredible participation from a wide spectrum of individuals. This is a collaborative process to create a worldwide community innovation project. The problem statement, solution, relevant experience, and funds requested will be displayed in the voting application. This will allow everyone to learn about the initiatives before voting on them.
The proposal plans and attachments can be viewed on our innovation platform, hosted by Ideascale, in order to gain an understanding of the details. This all means that we want everyone to feel confident in contributing to the discussion as a whole.
The quality of the output is dependent on the community’s ability to create and engage with new ideas. To that end, we would like to share a quick guide to writing successful proposals:
Proposing a title (35 char limit) # The proposal name should give an indication of the innovation that you are trying to achieve while also grabbing people’s attention. But we want to avoid any slick marketing speak. Just tell your audience what it does and who it is for as clearly as possible. Keep it simple and informative and keep your audience in mind.
Example Title:
Stake pool operator vlog network
How To Write a Problem Statement (140 Char limit) # Rising to the challenge # Each fund will have a specific challenge which proposals will attempt to solve. Challenges will originally be set by the Project Catalyst team and then opportunities will arise for the community to develop their own. It is crucial that proposals address the challenge directly. Here is an example of a challenge and some problem statements which address it.
Challenge # How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses
on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?
Problem statements
Builders don’t want to deal with the red tape\\time cost of securing funding.
How do we help Cardano builders streamline proposals?
I am trying to solve the problem of bootstrapping decentralized\\open
finance movement on Cardano before Plutus and Marlowe hit mainnet.
In both of these examples the relationship between the problem statements and the challenge is apparent. This is what voters will be looking for. However, while the content of the problem statements is clear and effective, these problem statements can be improved.
Making great problem statements (140 char. limit) # The problem statement identifies the issue related to the challenge, and offers a solution. It is important to focus on common problems, urgent problems, expensive problems, and frequent problems. Explaining your problem in these terms is crucial to a good proposal so it should be the first thing seen by voters. A good problem statement has four components: the desired outcome, blocking problem, costs of the problem, and the evidence.
Structure of the problem statement # Desired outcome: This paints a picture of the ideal set of circumstances once your solution is accepted.
Blocking problem: A concise explanation of the problem preventing this set of circumstances from occurring.
Costs of the problem: A summation of both the opportunity and financial costs of the problem to key stakeholders. This helps voters assess how much impact the problem has.
Evidence: Support for your position laid out in a detailed plan. Here\u0026rsquo;s an example:
Statement Component Description Desired Outcome We want to make it affordable to transfer money to workers living in the Philippines. Blocking problem 11% of the population of the Philippines lose money on transaction fees. Costs of the problem Around \$1 billion is paid in transfer fees annually. Evidence Link(s) to data which proves this. Here’s the complete problem statement which condenses the information above:
Money transfer to Philippines workers should be affordable. However, 11% of the population are losing 1B\$ in transaction fees per year. Research links [1],[2]“
In Conclusion
State your desired outcome and the problem blocking it Define the cost of the problem Give evidence for your findings Solution (140 Char limit) # Structuring the Solution # So, you only have 140 characters to give a lot of important information. When every character counts, it is important that you address the prompt exactly.
It may sound obvious, but your solution must be based on a known problem. It has to actually solve the problem laid out in the problem statement. A solution in search of a problem is rarely an attractive option because it is less efficient than filling a distinct need. So remember: start with solving a problem and then lay out the vision of your solution in the Plan in Detail section. Your 140 characters should address the problem, solve it, and give some insight into how your solution is different from others.
Example solution statement
How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?
In Conclusion
Address the problem directly to ensure that your solution rises to the challenge Make your project stand out through differentiation Create a solution that solves a problem instead of one looking for a problem. Relevant Experience (140 Char limit) # Find your edge # Find your ‘competitive edge’ and ensure you drive it home. We can break down your competitive edge into a couple of different categories. Your solution should include an explanation of as many of these competitive edges as possible. Remember, the people voting on these proposals want to see yours as a ‘sure thing’. If you can clearly explain why you are different from any of the other projects in the blockchain space, then you have a significant competitive advantage.
Founders # The people who are working on your proposal can lend their personal expertise and work history to the project.
Example Experience:
John Doe completed his PhD with a focus on incentive schemes for blockchain treasury systems.
In Conclusion*
Find your competitive edge and make sure that it is well known This might look different for different kinds of projects Remember that your audience is other people on the innovation platform Plan In Detail # Differentiate through insight # Now that we have outlined the problem and given a solid solution, let’s talk about execution. Different problems require different solutions. We are looking for a wide variety of project ideas from marketing campaigns and educational resources to developer infrastructure improvements and business development.
You should look at your plan as a roadmap and a need analysis. First of all, Why does your solution work? While you may have been the first to identify your problem it is important that you explain why your solution will be the most successful in a field of possible options.
Market # The market you have identified has not been previously accessed or prioritized. Markets should be identified that have 20 percent growth a year.
Example: Our hardware solution works with all proof-of-work blockchains.
Product # Your solution works in the market in a particularly impactful way.
Example: This hardware addition reduces energy consumption of mining rigs by 20 percent.
Acquisition # Your route to user and platform acquisition is clear and well thought out.
Example: Access to network information drives user acquisition for no cost.
Monopoly # As you grow in the field your company actually gets stronger.
Example: Using the Ouroboros protocol allows our system to become more secure as decentralization increases.
Show us the money: # Complex problems often need sufficient funding to be solved. This is understood by the community at Project Catalyst. However, anyone voting on these proposals should be able to know how the funding is being spent.
Giving a detailed breakdown of how the budget will be spent. This can come in a variety of ways but distilling your budget into a series of line items is a clear way to show voters that you have considered how major funding initiatives will be spent. It is also important to remember that your budget should meet the requirements of the project you’re setting out to accomplish. If you are trying to gain funding for a small meetup then a couple hundred dollars should be sufficient. If you are coordinating the development of critical infrastructure then you will need more resources. Make sure to pair the vision with the appropriate funding.
Example: Creating a developer focused podcast will take \$5k in the initial 6 months.
Getting on the road # When building your proposal, you should write as if you will be receiving funding. But it’s important that anyone reading your proposal understands that you will be able to hit the ground running. This is where your roadmap comes in. Your roadmap should break down all of the key milestones you intend to hit once funding is received. This can be done in a couple of different ways, but a good roadmap details your one month, three month, and six month goals.
In the roadmap it is also important to identify your key performance indicators (KPIs). These are the goals that you hit which demonstrate that you have been successful. Here are some examples of KPIs:
Users acquired Product capability built Performance benchmark reached Network stability achieved for x amount of time The important thing to remember about KPIs is that they should have a number attached to them. Acquiring an initial 15 users is an achievable goal. Acquiring ‘a lot’ of users is pretty vague and difficult for anyone to adjudicate. Remember, you are presenting these ideas to the community, the clearer you make your intentions and the easier it is to verify that you have achieved your goals, the more likely it is that you will be seen as a great bet.
Intellectual Property # Please share with reviewers what is your IP policy (Patents, trademarks, copyright, licensing etc’) so they can assess if that is a good fit for the treasury.
Defining Success # What does success look like for this particular project? While it might not be entirely complete after one round of funding, your proposal should give us an idea of what an end state looks like. This, like your KPIs should be an easily understood number that can be verified by anyone.
In Conclusion # Suit the budget and the roadmap to the needs of your project. Establish reachable key performance indicators that show good progress towards your goal. Establish intellectual property rights so that everyone knows who owns what. Define success for your project. Attachments/links # It is important for everyone to be able to share additional necessary information. That is why PDFs, images and additional URLs can be sent through the Ideascale where they can be viewed by everyone.
FeedBack # Community support # In order to make each individual proposal as strong as possible we encourage everyone to use the innovation platform to discuss each idea. In fact, we’ve created reviewer guidelines to help you direct your critique. For a productive and informative conversation we encourage everyone to focus their feedback on the following areas:
Auditability: What details are missing from the proposal to help reviewers accurately assess the project?
Impact: How can the proposal better address the challenge? How can we encourage people to build dApps on Cardano in the next 6 months?
Feasibility: What are ways that the proposal’s budget, plan, and scope can be modified in order to make it more achievable.
Example
If your marketing initiative gave the exact number of users it was attempting to onboard as a KPI then it would be much easier to track its success.
In conclusion* # Make other proposals stronger by giving good feedback Incorporate useful feedback into your own proposal Participate actively in the innovation process to make sure it continues to grow How To Write a Community Choice Proposal # Emancipating the community # The purpose of having the Project Catalyst community write their own challenge is to emancipate the platform from the Project Catalyst team. Eventually, the Cardano community will control the innovation and collaboration process from inception to delivery. With that in mind, it is crucial that we understand what an impactful challenge looks like.
Focus on advancement # The challenge is a question which helps the community focus its creativity on advancing the Cardano ecosystem. Of course, ‘advancement’ means different things to different people. The key to writing an impactful challenge question is balance. It must be broad enough to be addressed in multiple ways, but specific enough to enhance the value of Cardano for everyone.
Challenge question examples # Below are a couple examples of challenge questions:
Too Specific
How can stake pool operators based in southern Europe make their pool more attractive delegators in the next 2 months?
This challenge question addresses only stake pool operators in Southern Europe. Cardano is a global ecosystem which allows participation in many different ways. The challenge question should help everyone.
Too Broad
How can we make Cardano more useful?
Of course, we want Cardano to be more useful but this challenge doesn’t give the participants any parameters to spark their creativity. Constraints are necessary to help the community address the direct needs of the ecosystem.
Just Right
How can we encourage entrepreneurs to develop businesses on Cardano in the next six months?
This challenge has a time frame and addresses a community which is important to the entire Cardano community. Furthemore, it can be addressed in many different ways through both technical and non-technical contributions. However, writing challenge questions is only one important part of Project Catalyst. Addressing those challenges in a clear and concise manner is also necessary to identifying the most impactful ideas for Project Catalyst.

Campaign Brief # Community Advisors are an evolving key role of Project Catalyst and need a place and budget to submit proposals to improve their performance.
Why is it important? # Community Advisors are facing constantly challenges but dont have the possibility to actively co-design their acitivity.
What does success look like? # Community Advisors (CAs) submitting proposals as a Team to improve the CAs performance, activity and evolution.
Key Metrics to measure # Number of new tools developed Number of new mechanisms for assessing and scoring proposals Number of maintenance proposals and groups created Number of out of the box ideas Challenge Brief # Community Advisors (CAs) and Veteran Community Advisors (vCAs) are key players of the current Project Catalyst governance process. They assess proposals and by doing that, provide feedback to proposers to improve their ideas for the next fund, and support voter on deciding which proposals are more ready and have higher chances of being successful and impact the Cardano ecosystem.
By improving the assessing process, we improve the whole Catalyst process as a consequence. Therefore, this challenge aims at accelerating the evolution of the whole assessing process of Catalyst.
Potential directions # Build new tools to improve (v)CA\u0026rsquo;s work Maintain general (v)CA resourses, in collaboration with the community and with IOG Evaluate different models of proposal assessment and scoring Develop reputation system(s) for (v)CAs Develop and assess new remuneration mechanisms for (v)CAs `}),e.add({id:43,href:"/catalyst/fund7/challenges/community-events/campaign-brief/",title:"Community Events",description:"How can we increase meaningful participation among the community in the next 6 months?",content:`Fund Size: \`200,000 USD paid in Ada

Campaign Brief # There are already many community-driven events taking place in the wider Catalyst community and this challenge will ensure that these efforts remain sustainable. Since most of the fund distribution for Fund 7 is decided by the community, we as a community have to create this challenge for ourselves.
These events are important and critical for the success of Catalyst because they are bringing the community together and they introduce and onboard new people to our ecosystem. Furthermore the community has used these sessions for collaborative problems sensing and also new teams and initiatives were established. Overall, community events give our community its face and personal touch.
Guiding Questions # How can we increase meaningful participation in Project Catalyst among all stakeholders? How can we increase voter-proposer interaction? How can we onboard and integrate new people into Project Catalyst? How can we use events to build new teams? How can workshops increase collaboration in Project Catalyst? How can active participation in events be increased? How can the number of participants in events be increased? -How can events help keep the community together? Why is it Important? # Community-driven projects like Catalyst need organized events to connect, discuss ideas, solve problems together and initiate collaboration.
How does success look like? # A diverse community characterized by high engagement, collaborative problem sensing and strong execution teams.

Campaign Brief # The goal of this challenge is to find ways to further engage the Japanese community and to help create ways for the Japanese and English speaking community to connect. Proposers are encouraged to propose in Japanese and the Challenge team will help promote the CA role in the Eastern Town hall or equivalent event.
The budget is set to 50k because the Challenge focuses only on a specific part of the community. There are also projects from Japan which have a broad application and will fit in other challenges. Considering the focus is on community building the budget should be enough to support 2-6 meaningful efforts.
Why is it Important? # There has been an interest in Cardano in Japan from the start and the country has had a progressive stance towards blockchain technology. This makes Japan a likely country to adopt solutions built on top of Cardano. There are already some active community members and SPO\u0026rsquo;s but participation in Catalyst is still relatively low.
Recently an Eastern Town Hall was started by community members and participation in the Japanese breakout room has been among the highest consistently. In the fund 6 challenges there are several proposals coming from the Japanese community as well. With the current momentum a challenge in fund 7 would likely see good participation and can solidify the community.
At the moment most of Ideascale \u0026amp; Catalyst operates in english. This creates a barrier for all non-english communities. If solutions from this challenge prove successful in bridging that gap, they can function as an example for other communities.
Possible directions: # Translating key documentation Creating educational content about Cardano \u0026amp; Catalyst in Japanese Organising interpreters for Catalyst events Organising workshops for new members, CA\u0026rsquo;s, SPO\u0026rsquo;s, proposers Setting up community hubs `}),e.add({id:45,href:"/catalyst/fund8/challenges/cross-chain-collaboration/campaign-brief/",title:"Cross Chain-Collaboration",description:"How might we create connections and collaboration between Cardano and other blockchains in the next six months?",content:` Fund Size: 400,000 USD paid in Ada

Campaign Brief # How might we create connections and collaboration between Cardano and other blockchains in the next six months?
Why is it important? # Interoperability of blockchains and multi-chain awareness guarantees shared success of the cryptoeconomy as a whole.
What does Sucess look like? # Collaborative value creation between Project Catalyst and other communities. Both technical and non-technical initiatives are welcome.
Key Metrics to measure # Objective metrics to measure success:
Mainnet and testnet transaction volume growth Number of proposals including participants from other blockchain communities Number of technical implementations connecting Cardano to other blockchains Ideas from other chains implemented by Catalyst Projects and dApps from other chains implemented on Cardano Catalyst-created solutions adopted by other chains/communities Number of events / workshops / sessions arranged with other communities Number of permanent initiatives with cross-chain teams (members from different blockchain communities together) Challenge Brief # The success of Bitcoin spawned numerous off-shoot experiments and the arrival of Ethereum increased tribalism. As the number of altcoins grew, unhealthy \u0026ldquo;maximalism\u0026rdquo; emerged. The future is multi-chain, however, and the cryptoeconomy thrives when interoperability and cross-chain collaboration are cherished and encouraged.
There are multiple next generation blockchains with cadres of zealous supporters, highly skilled developers and innovative technologies that Cardano and Project Catalyst can learn from. And, vice versa, we can help other networks thrive by offering the good practices developed in Catalyst. IOG has recently formed the UTXO alliance and started collaboration with numerous partners like COTI and SingularityNET. It\u0026rsquo;s a good start but more is needed to address the lack of communication, coordination and collaboration between blockchain communities. Missing awareness of each other\u0026rsquo;s doings forces us to duplicate our efforts. When we are separate we are not able to learn from each other\u0026rsquo;s achievements or failures.
Cardano has a strong, open and inclusive community, let\u0026rsquo;s make this a real super power and let\u0026rsquo;s be the first ones to forge strong bonds. Let\u0026rsquo;s create an enriching, open and safe environment, where people from different communities can find common ground and share knowledge, resources, skills, ideas and visions with one another. Let\u0026rsquo;s go out there, break the silos and build bridges and presence between us.
Here are some examples of potential DLT/Blockchain entities, communities and projects to explore and collaborate with:
Cosmos, dubbing itself the Internet of Blockchains, makes it easy for other blockchains to connect to it via their Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol (IBC). Massive projects like Binance Smart Chain, Terra, Thorchain and Oasis Network are built on the Cosmos SDK.
TenderMint Cosmos Intro Cosmos Network Polkadot (and its canary network Kusama) is a light-weight and quickly updateable design where the Relay Chain offers shared security and cross-chain communication, allowing the connected Parachains to focus on fast deployment of services. Its unique crowdloan mechanism invites the community of token holders to voice out which projects should be implemented first. The Nominated Proof of Stake network offers advanced governance mechanisms as well.
Academically impressive and technologically sound Algorand has a unique consensus mechanism Pure Proof of Stake and we can learn a lot from their governance model.
Boasting a throughput beyond 4,500 tps and near-instant finality, the EVM-compatible Avalanche has quickly become the go-to choice for multiple DeFi projects. It has an innovative multi-chain architecture that utilizes both DAG and Blockchain technologies.
Avax Other examples could be e.g. Fantom, Solana, IOTA, Polygon, Nervos or any community that is ready for multi-chain reality. Or the proposal can come from a project / solution built on any of these.
Proposals you can submit to this challenge # This is an open-ended challenge that welcomes any proposal geared for cross-chain collaboration, co-innovation and interoperability. These can be any community-led projects, initiatives, solutions, tools or services. It could mean for instance:
New technical implementations connecting Cardano to other blockchains and vice versa (SDKs, APIs, bridges etc) Governance ideas from other chains implemented as part of the Voltaire road map Already successful projects expanding from other chains to Cardano Expansion of Cardano-based projects into other chains Oracles and other tools to interpret and interact with cross-chain data Catalyst-created solutions adopted by other chains and communities Common research, education, outreach and innovation projects with other chains and communities (e.g. podcasts, hackathons, webinars, communication hubs, educational resources) Challenge Team # We are seasoned Catalyst community members and \u0026ldquo;interoperability maximalists\u0026rdquo; who don\u0026rsquo;t believe that any one chain should rule them all.
Filip Blagojević is an active Project Catalyst member since Fund 2, Plutus Pioneer, Atala Pioneer and Emurgo Academy trainee. Tomi Astikainen is a Veteran Community Advisor who has recently written a book for wannabe crypto investors. He is a Senior Ambassador for Acala/Karura and a driver in the Polkadot/Kusama community in Finland. Felix Weber is an active Project Catalyst member, Cardano Ambassador and initiator/leader of several community led Projects and initiatives. Our assessment of the maturity of this proposed challenge: # Cardano technology stack is finally mature enough to start inviting proposals for cross-chain collaboration and interoperability. Our proposed challenge is intentionally left open ended and it welcomes a multitude of different solutions. Worthwhile ideas submitted in this challenge should help grow and improve the Cardano and Catalyst community in the near term (next 6-9 months).
This challenge is therefore aligned with the Fund8 strategic goals:
It helps prepare people to make contributions to the Cardano and Catalyst ecosystem. It helps turn Cardano into an open source project recognized also beyond our community. It accelerates the growth and evolution of our developer \u0026amp; app ecosystem by inviting contributions from the rest of the blockchain space. The budget of \$400,000 USD is a moderate 2,5% of the total treasury allocation for Fund8. It should be sufficient to kickstart interoperability and cross-chain collaboration initiatives but might not be enough for any large scale infrastructure projects. Therefore, we encourage submission of \u0026ldquo;minimum viable\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;proof of concept\u0026rdquo; proposals that do include long-term vision and roadmap but which are initially scoped quite small.

https://aragon.org https://daostack.io https://colony.io https://www.molochdao.com https://abridged.io https://kleros.io Cardano needs: # Similar tools that offer superior features to those offered on other chains.
Effective Collaboration Management Platforms to Organize Community Intentions and Actions
Additional not yet existing tools to give Cardano a distinct advantage
Tools for prospective organizations to use in evaluating the features available in Cardano DAO\u0026rsquo;s:
DAO community collaboration DAO creation DAO operation DAO governance. Why is it Important? # Blockchain applications have moved from Currency to DeFi, to NFT. DAOs are Next. Cardano needs to be ready for when that happens.
How does success look like? # There are no better ways to manage your DAO than to use Cardano DAOs. From Small Business to Global Communities.. Cardano DAOs deliver.
Key Metrics to measure # Number of Communities engaged in collaboration using Cardano DAO creation tools. Amount of ADA coming from DAOs transaction fees after the solutions on this challenge get implemented (\u0026gt; than the challenge\u0026rsquo;s allocated fund amount) Number of DAOs that use Cardano as governance/management chain in 6 months.

Challenge Brief # Cardano is an ecosystem that sets itself apart through its rigorous research and strives to do things correctly. We expect all dApp projects applying for funding to aspire to the highest possible levels of certification. To understand what this refers to and practically means, please watch Charles Hoskinson\u0026rsquo;s video on this topic: \u0026ldquo;DApp certification and Community Curation\u0026rdquo;.
This challenge is suitable for incorporated technology or blockchain companies and larger projects with competent teams that already have deployed MVPs. Ideally, these are projects that have a proven user base. Projects that satisfy such criteria are welcome to apply for more than \$100,000 if that can be justified and clearly budgeted for.
For smaller teams (4-5 people) with proven competence, relevant experience and technical skills with sketches/whitepaper detailing how they would go about to launch their proposal, the budgets would typically be in the range \$40,000-\$80,000.
For people with the relevant background but without a full team or completed whitepaper detailing the solution, the project ought to be considered as a research stage project and budgets should less than \$10,000.

Campaign page
Challenge Brief # Dapps, Products \u0026amp; Integrations is focused on the following areas:
Creation or improvement of different Dapps, products, and integrations that provide value to the Cardano community and wider ecosystem. Integrations with other existing services, products, and protocols that improve the end-user experience whether that\u0026rsquo;s giving the user more options or making something easier to use that benefits the wider ecosystem. Cardano needs a thriving ecosystem of different Dapps, products and integrations for the community to use that increasingly become the better alternatives over current centralized providers.
The more interesting and useful the products and integrations are that can be built in the ecosystem the more reasons people have to interact with the Cardano blockchain that can help further drive more adoption, feedback, growth and even more innovations.
Types of proposals to include # DeFi - Stable coins, DEXs, borrow \u0026amp; lending, synthetic assets, etc. Marketplaces Gaming - Open world games, card games, RPG, etc. Transport \u0026amp; logistics Hardware - Hardware wallets, Local ATMs for interacting with the blockchain, etc. Physical products - Tokenised housing as a Cardano native asset, International crypto headquarters and liason office on every continent, etc. Social media Nation governance systems - New governance systems for nation-states Environment - Solutions that help to solve environmental issues Many others - Any other idea, product or integration that someone thinks should be built in the Cardano ecosystem! Potential success metrics for proposal types # DeFi - Total value locked, the total number of users, number of active daily/weekly/monthly users Marketplaces - Total number of users, number of transactions performed Gaming - Number of players, player income generated (if play to earn), qualitative feedback on game experience, etc. Transport \u0026amp; logistics - Total number of packages tracked, Number of counterfeit items prevented Hardware - Number of items sold, number of total users, number of interactions with hardware solution Physical products - Number of products tokenised as a native asset, Number of people using physical solutions Nation governance systems - Amount of population onboarded, amount of costs saved due to new solution, security difficulty improvements over previous approach Social media - Total number of users, number of meaningful interactions Environment - Total number of users, total CO2 sequestered, amount of awareness being produced, number of people changing an environmentally damaging habit Many others - Proposers can add in whatever metrics or success criteria make sense for their own project! Considerations for proposers
Existing products or integrations - What products or integrations already exist in the ecosystem? What are the core differences between the proposal being presented and those existing ones and why will that provide impact to the ecosystem?
Technical requirements - Does the Cardano ecosystem have the right tools, libraries and SDKs for the idea to be feasible? What needs to be introduced or improved for the proposal to fully reach its potential?
Ecosystem maturity requirements - Why is this product or integration suitable for execution right now? Are there enough pieces of infrastructure, applications or other integrations available that would be needed for this suggested proposal to have a strong chance of gaining adoption? For instance, if you were making a professional social network DApp, do the right identity tools and wallets exist to make a professional network feasible?
Funding Categories Background # Funding Categories is an approach to doing funding categorisation that will welcome all ideas, maximize the amount of ideas submitted and reduce the effort for all stakeholders in the Catalyst process.
Funding categories also help remove the existing issues with challenge settings. They help to prevent duplicate challenge settings, remove challenges created by self interest, reduce the need for deep knowledge of the ecosystem from challenge proposal teams and also removes an easy entry point for malicious actors.
The full documentation for Catalyst Funding Categories can be found here
7 funding categories have been documented to cover all forms of ideas and proposals. All proposals can be found here
The budget weighting for the 7 categories has been determined using a community governance process. The voting results for this process can be found here
In closing: # The potential opportunities that Catalyst can provide to genuine dapp and product developers have increased substantially. A 32x increase in the span of a year.
At the same time, it’s now up to the Catalyst community to drive the direction of the experiment by setting the challenges that provide funding opportunities for developers.
We, in the Catalyst community, need to change our perspective on the nascent experiment and enable it to grow up.
It’s time for the Catalyst community to step up and provide developers with the challenges that will unlock the funds they need to be able to develop for, and on Cardano with confidence.
It’s time to think big!
Why is it important? # Quality Dapps, products and integrations will increase the utility \u0026amp; adoption of Cardano.
What does success look like? # Novel and viable applications and products get built on top of Cardano attracting users. Integrations manage to pull in more adoption.
Key Metrics to measure # Tracking success for this category will mean:
Increasing the number of dapps and products available for the community to use that help to enrich the ecosystem with new use cases. Increase the number of integrations that bring existing solutions together for a more seamless and connected experience between different products. Increased quality of existing products \u0026amp; integrations through suggested improvements that is supported by customer feedback or increased usage by the community.

Campaign page and browse ideasand Git Repository and Git Book
Campaign Brief # In a proof of stake system with distributed governance a common understanding of truth and reliance on authentic sources of correct and provable information can be crucial for avoiding a splitting of the community into two or more feuding camps.
A distributed denial-of-truth (DDoT) attack could be defined as a malicious attempt to disrupt the normal operations of a community, service or network by overwhelming the target, its surrounding infrastructure and community with a flood of disinformation and malinformation.
Disinformation is fabricated or deliberately manipulated audio/visual/text content, intentionally created conspiracy theories or rumors or to sow mistrust. With disinformation the bad information is spread with the intent to deceive.
Malinformation is the deliberate publication of information for personal or corporate rather than public interest. Deliberate change of context, date or time of genuine content.
These DDoT attack scenarios may emerge as a combined outside/inside attack and spread faster in fiercely tribal communities, such as a cryptocurrency community. A DDoT attack might overwhelm a system with false information, leading to a plunge in confidence / community split.
\u0026ldquo;Right now everybody is implicitly assuming that the only possible victim is an election,\u0026rdquo; says David Perlman, a former Twitter Inc. data scientist who is now developing ways for corporations to counter disinformation at the computer security company Leviathan Security Group Inc. \u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s no reason that a company couldn\u0026rsquo;t be a victim,\u0026rdquo; he says.*
Brands Face a New Online Threat: Disinformation Attacks A bad faith player may secretly prepare for this scenario out of particular interests that are not publicly visible initially. This can be done with the help of some major holders/exchanges/rival coins/investors and/or media personalities.
We are all aware how a single person (Elon Musk) is already able to move crypto markets, while a handful of prominent Cardano personas with outside support might be able to do the same.
Proposers in this challenge would focus on improving the transparency of all segments of Cardano treasury monetary transfers and make \u0026ldquo;beginner-friendly\u0026rdquo; tutorials on how to monitor financial events from the very inception of Cardano and its main founding entities.
Proposers would also focus on shining a powerful light on old and new attempts to game the system, further scams, fleece users, sow distrust, spread lies and destabilize the community.
Many possible DDoT scenarios may evolve if the Cardano community is not proactively working to prevent them.
One invented - example DDoT scenario to illustrate how things can go wrong fast:
Example scenario involving bad faith: A former/current head or founder or leading researcher/manager of one of the three founding entities of Cardano issues an untrue statement questioning the legitimacy of efforts/intentions of another founding entity or possible financial shenanigans.
Several prominent community SPOs side with the accusing entity, as do several leading Youtube influencers and crypto media. Other side with the accused side. Some companies start distancing themselves.
Rumors circulate that one founding entity allegedly secretly siphoned funds and that has been done behind the scenes. Another rumor circulates that one of the Cardano entities has installed a backdoor and several SPOs announce they have reduced their pledges out of fear. Panic spreads. The allegations are amplified through social media.
Truth is hard to establish - references are made to talks and private discussions, public allegations are difficult to verify.
The general community has no way to verify the true merits of the claims - as they are undocumented. Two camps emerge. Cardano community splits along fault lines. This adds more fuel to the fire. ADA value plunges. The very sources of truth in the Cardano ecosystem come under question. The entire system teeters. A DDOT attack by a group of two dozen well organized distributed players is underway. Governance is rocked.
Why is it Important? # Legacy systems have been brought to the brink by the inability of stakeholders, participants and the public to agree on what is truth.
How does success look like? # Truth about Cardano and ongoing and past events is easy to establish even for newcomers. Trust not being eroded. Transparency is enhanced.
Key Metrics to measure # Easier access to information about the Cardano treasury and its funds, treasury disbursement, past, current and future monetary policy Historical transactions from the treasury and founding entities can be easily identified by any non-power user of Cardano with a couple of clicks Treasury 101 information sources are established explaining the basics of how the Treasury works and how all Treasury-related facts can be verified independently - with how-to-guides Repository of old/new scams, scam attempts, fake debunked theories and falsehoods can be easily checked and accessed Community-managed websites expand to include more beginner-friendly content about Cardano Treasury, ADA inflation rate, future monetary policy ADA calculators Community-managed websites expand to include historical and current content about different types of Cardano scams, bad-faith players, untruths and FUD spreading. New sources and repositories of information are developed containing timelines for Cardano project, FAQs and criticisms of Cardano as well as answers to criticisms. Better tools for searching and transcribing information from IOG\u0026rsquo;s Cardano 360 shows, Charles Hoskinson\u0026rsquo;s AMAs and from other leading community members are developed. `}),e.add({id:58,href:"/catalyst/fund6/challenges/disaster/campaign-brief/",title:"Disaster: When all is at stake",description:`How can we help SPOs tackle risks \u0026amp; plan, develop and participate in disaster recovery tests in a safe hiccup-free and decentralized manner?

Having a disaster recovery strategy in place enables an organization to maintain or quickly resume mission-critical functions following a disruption.
Cardano as a proposed financial operating system for the world must have several layers of built in redundancies even for events that may seem remote or very unlikely now.
Although a testnet exists, real-world conditions can never be fully replicated. Maybe proposers can develop a way of incentivizing further SPO participation in the Cardano testnet and more simulations.

Campaign Brief # High-quality and decentralized decision-making, will increase treasury ROI and legitimize decentralized governance.
How success looks like # The community is consciously improving decision-making processes while growing a group of committed and collaborative leaders.
Key metrics to measure # To assess ROI of this challenge we will ask ourselves: Did we get better at distributed decision making? Community confidence: avg rating or % of Catalyst members who approve of overall results of a funding round. Community participation: number of Catalyst participants contributing to improving Catalyst decision making systems Measured overall Impact of individual initiatives Proof of iteration: round over round, is there evidence that \u0026ldquo;pain points\u0026rdquo; are evolving? (Failure would look like seeing the same problems emerging each funding round) Re-election rates: if proposers receive subsequent funding, this can be seen as a sign of success Embracing failure: is the community able to see value in \u0026amp; learn from proposals that did not work out? Guiding questions # How do we encourage people to participate in decision making?
How do we ensure the group of decision makers is diverse and accessible to newcomers?
How can we ensure that the Catalyst process keeps iterating to improve?
How will we include the community in decision making?

Campaign Brief # Whatever your background, confidently communicating all the important elements of an early stage venture can be overwhelming for inexperienced entrepreneurs.
More should be done to help an increasingly diverse group of Project Catalyst entrepreneurs, at different stages of self-development, plus their teams and stakeholders to collaborate and communicate effectively.
This is important to Project Catalyst as, over time, the strongest ideas will be those that are the most coherently communicated and which ultimately resonate clearly with voters - particularly Expert evaluators!
This challenge seeks to help inexperienced entrepreneurs to learn and apply vital entrepreneurship skills so they can collaborate with teams and stakeholders on meaningful Catalyst projects. This also helps ensure sustainable impact and a positive return on investment and intention is made.
Why is it important? # Entrepreneurs strengths are ambition and vision but often lack structure to communicate ideas clearly enough to win voter hearts \u0026amp; minds
How does success look like? # Higher quality of proposal submitted to Catalyst so entrepreneurs become confident presenting project principles, USP, strategy, objectives
Key Metrics to measure # Number of users, using the tools Difference in score of applicants using the toolbox and those not using the tools. Gaps that are filled in the entrepreneurial skills base of project teams from the start of ideation through project delivery. Sustainability of venture plans beyond the scope of Catalyst development project.

Challenge Brief # The dRep could not be more important to Cardano given the following
The participation rate of Catalyst voting is less than 20%. Statistics show that 30% of Catalyst voters randomly vote without reading the proposals. It is difficult for Catalyst users who are not necessarily skilled in technology and English to judge nearly 1,000 proposals. Potential relevance to Decentralized Consortium Funding and roadmap approval voting through 2025. For the dRep to function better, the following four elements are necessary
dReps must be diverse. There should be many dReps. High delegation participation rate. Appropriate selection of dReps for delegation. Failure to achieve (1) and (2) is centralization, and failure to achieve (3) and (4) is Catalyst dysfunction.
Therefore, after one year, \u0026ldquo;(1) More than 200 dReps from more than 100 countries have participated. (2) Voters are voting with more than 50% and with careful consideration of their mandate.\u0026rdquo;
This proposal was created to create a situation where What tools, events, support, and content would fully achieve the KPIs? Let\u0026rsquo;s think about it!
Why is it important? # Without a diverse and many dRep participation will make us centralized. and without an easy and proper voter delegation would make us dysfunctional.
What does success look like? # After one year;
200+ dReps from 100+ countries have participated. 50%+ of the voters are voting “carefully” Key Metrics to measure # Diversity of dReps: Did it lead to the onboarding of diverse dReps with different languages, national origins, occupations, genders, ages, religions, etc.? Number of dReps: How many dReps were onboarded? Number of delegates: How much did it contribute to increasing the number of delegates to dReps?

Campaign Brief # Global entertainment+media market = \$2 trillion. A decentralized FAM network to produce quality Cardano community media is vital yet absent.
Why is it important? # A challenge category for creatives has been absent so far. Diversity + human creativity in the arts can enrich the Cardano ecosystem + more
What does success look like? # Teams collaborating equitably to produce inclusive, high quality multimedia content + platforms = increase knowledge + adoption of Cardano
Key Metrics to measure # As a measure of the health of the ecosystem:

Cardano has a strong YouTube community, but obviously YouTube is not everything and it\u0026rsquo;s not received well in many perspectives. We need a bridge between YouTube, the traditional media, TV and film. We need to communicate a clear message towards media.
It\u0026rsquo;s crucial to create educational and inspiring content which the national media and TV stations would gladly use in their daily programmes.
In this early stage, the cooperation between YouTubers and TV \u0026amp; Film professionals is not only welcomed, it\u0026rsquo;s needed. Creating a specific challenge for this should open the gates for both education and inspiration.
The Film and Media (FAM) Challenge aims to boost knowledge and adoption of Cardano for global audiences by enabling:
a challenge platform for the facilitation of professionals and creatives to connect, collaborate and coordinate
the launch of projects that spotlight the multitude of stories within the Cardano ecosystem
multimedia projects that illustrate how Cardano\u0026rsquo;s blockchain is the \u0026lsquo;green blockchain\u0026rsquo; solution in a world that needs solutions to the climate emergency
A dedicated challenge category for this creative group to platform their catalysing ideas has been absent thus far. This has led to potentially impactful projects struggling to find their place in Challenge categories that are not quite the \u0026lsquo;right fit\u0026rsquo;. The FAM challenge category can unlock a flow of submission of ideas and proposals that bring about high quality, educational and inspirational multi-lingual multi-media content.
Content that helps build bridges within the Cardano ecosystem and across multi sectoral ecosystems, globally. So FAM creatives, in all corners of the world, step up. You are the ones we have been waiting for.

Campaign Brief # Security of the network relies on a decentralised pool of SPO\u0026rsquo;s to run it. Without proper support, smaller SPO\u0026rsquo;s will struggle against big players moving in and pushing them out untill they have a majority market share.

On the other hand, running nodes and participating in the network can be a great way for community initiatives to support their projects. By supporting and promoting smaller mission focussed SPO\u0026rsquo;s the security of the whole network benefits. Larger hosting providers are also notorious for caring little for their environmental footprint.

What this is not: # This is not a proposal that needs active work by the proposers, it is a vision that needs votes to become an achievement. If it succeeds the beneficiary is the whole Cardano community. It is a call to close our prejudices and open our eyes, hearts and minds to good people who lack the environmental benefits many of us were born with. Giving them an opportunity to show that circumstances are not something they need charity to rise above and succeed.

Throughout human history and civilization, it has been that every few centuries or so a confluence of factors align to transition us from one phase of development to another; The first and second industrial revolutions are prime examples. Right now we are barely out of the Web2 revolution and a fourth Industrial revolution or Web3 is upon us.
Although Africa did not play a key role in the first, second or third industrial revolution, it is poised to be a leader in Web 3.0 technology and those with foresight are positioning themselves strategically.
The Cardano community can be one of these visionaries. Let\u0026rsquo;s be serious about seeding long term projects in Africa to capture a large share of an important emerging market.
Rationale for budget # Let\u0026rsquo;s be frank here. We need much more than 250k to continue seeding Cardano in Africa. We are asking for this amount because of Catalyst voting patterns; in that \$250k is better than \$0 and Wada and Partners can still take advantage of other challenge categories to help expand Cardano in Africa.

Challenge Brief # It\u0026rsquo;s no secret that Cardano is recognized as a blockchain with a strong focus on Africa, and formally stated as such in Cardano\u0026rsquo;s strategic goals. However, as other blockchain protocols recognize the potential of crypto in Africa, without concrete sustained action, Cardano risks losing a potential \$1 trillion in market share of the African market to other blockchains within the next 3 years.
Africa\u0026rsquo;s crypto market has grown by \$105 billion in the last year (2020-2021). Africa is the next crypto frontier- World Economic Forum Alameda Research, Coinbase Ventures, Cadenza, CMT Digital, Distributed Global, GSR, Third Prime and Avon Ventures: African Crypto Exchange VALR Raises \$50M in Series B Led by Pantera Capital In Catalyst Fund7 the combined Africa funded projects amount was almost negligible compared to those from western and developed economies
This needs to be reversed through intentional action. Otherwise smaller and smaller portions of Catalyst funding will continue to be allocated to projects focused on African and other emerging economies due to endemic barriers.
\u0026ldquo;Having a funding round that focuses on Africa is a win, win, win scenario. Africa wins by getting some backing.

Why is it important? # The Cardano community leans heavily toward North America and Europe. Growth elsewhere requires our support and initiative as a community.
What does success look like? # A broad spectrum of people across Asia and connected to Asia, coming together and forming teams to grow our ecosystem.
Key Metrics to measure # At the end of this challenge, we will be asking ourselves some questions about the quality of participation:
The number of proposals originating from East Asian participants in Project Catalyst
The quantity and quality of funded proposals originating from East Asian teams.
The observed impact of funded projects (meeting their KPIs).
Did we increase the participation of the Cardano community and Catalyst teams with East Asian residents?
Was there an increase in Daily/Monthly Active Wallets (DAW/MAW) as a proxy measure of momentum and engagement
Did we increase the number of Stake Pools and Stake Pool Operators based in East Asia?
We will also be asking some specific questions about the quality of the proposals:
Is there good feedback on funded project progress, failure or success, that help us understand the nuances of deploying Cardano solutions across East Asia?
What is the novelty and appropriateness of solutions?
Are we on track to improve the lives of people using Cardano in East Asia?
Was social and environmental impact evaluation used to measure proposal performance?
What is the sustainability of proposals beyond the scope of Catalyst?
Challenge Brief # As in Africa, raising the awareness levels of regular people in East Asia about blockchain and the Cardano network should be a priority for the Catalyst community. In this challenge, we provide funding for people who have learned about Cardano to take advantage of the community\u0026rsquo;s support and build on or use the Cardano network.
The nature of the proposals for this challenge is open-ended. Their only requirement is to originate or focus on East Asia and include east Asian team members or focus on East Asian participants.
For instance, the overwhelming majority of Stake Pools reside in North America and Europe. The Cardano network will be more resilient when Stake Pools are evenly distributed across the globe. The Catalyst community needs to step up and intentionally make that happen.
Cardano started life in East Asia (Japan and Hong Kong), and Emurgo focuses on East Asia. Let\u0026rsquo;s build upon that.
What this is: # A call to action; Activate the Cardano community\u0026rsquo;s ability to recognise, reward the opportunity to make the world a better place. East Asia is fertile ground for the adoption of Cardano. The return on intention (ROI) is likely to be high because projects in young and developing economies face less economic inertia.
Addressing different parts of the world directly and intentionally through funding challenges makes our community more accessible. It makes us more resilient. It helps us learn and understand the needs of communities that make up our ecosystem.
It is a vision that needs votes to become an achievement. When the challenge succeeds, the beneficiary is the whole Cardano community. It is a call to close our prejudices and open our eyes, hearts and minds to good people who lack the benefits many of us were born with—allowing others with fewer privileged circumstances to rise and succeed.

Addressing different parts of the world directly and intentionally through funding challenges makes our community more accessible. It makes us more resilient. It helps us learn and understand the needs of communities that make up our ecosystem.
It is a vision that needs votes to become an achievement. When the challenge succeeds, the beneficiary is the whole Cardano community. It is a call to close our prejudices and open our eyes, hearts and minds to good people who lack the benefits many of us were born with—allowing others with fewer privileged circumstances to rise and succeed.
Why is it important? # The Cardano community leans heavily toward North America and Europe. Growth elsewhere requires our support and initiative as a community.
What does success look like? # A broad spectrum of people across Asia and connected to Asia, coming together and forming teams to grow our ecosystem.
Key Metrics to measure # At the end of this challenge, we will be asking ourselves some questions about the quality of participation :
The number of proposals originating from East Asian participants in Project Catalyst The quantity and quality of funded proposals originating from East Asian teams The observed impact of funded projects (meeting their KPIs) Did we increase the participation of the Cardano community and Catalyst teams with East Asian residents? Was there an increase in Daily/Monthly Active Wallets (DAW/MAW) as a proxy measure of momentum and engagement Did we increase the number of Stake Pools and Stake Pool Operators based in East Asia? We will also be asking some specific questions about the quality of the proposals :
Is there good feedback on funded project progress, failure or success that help us understand the nuances of deploying Cardano solutions across East Asia? What is the novelty and appropriateness of solutions? Are we on track to improve the lives of people using Cardano in East Asia? Was social and environmental impact evaluation used to measure proposal performance? What is the sustainability of proposals beyond the scope of Catalyst? `}),e.add({id:73,href:"/catalyst/fund8/challenges/grow-india-grow-cardano/campaign-brief/",title:"Grow India, Grow Cardano",description:"How can we grow Cardano development and adoption in India?",content:` Fund Size: 150,000 USD paid in Ada

Campaign Brief # How can we grow Cardano development and adoption in India?
Why is it important? # 1.4B people. 55% under 30y (2016 est)
Local Cardano developers/businesses needed to solve local issues.
Significant poverty/unbanked
What does success look like? # Success is having multiple submissions for Catalyst Fund8 for India focused projects, with real-world projects getting funded and built.
Key Metrics to measure # The overall key metrics would be:
Increased interaction between Catalyst and Indian focused projects Number of Indian focused Catalyst submissions Number of Indian focused dapps/services actually built Challenge Brief # As well as Africa, I think we should also put significant focus on Cardano within India.
India has a massive population of 1.4 billion.
55% are under the age of 30yrs (Wikipedia, 2016 est.) There are a significant percentage of unbanked/rural people worldpoverty.io notes 100 million Indians (7%) live in extreme poverty Certain rural areas are already using Aadhaar Pay to pay for goods using their fingerprint see https://www.payaadhar. In 2019). So there is enough infrastructure and consumer devices in place to make this a serious market right away.
Having an India focused Catalyst challenge/fund would be very useful to gather teams and ideas and get the Cardano ball rolling in India. I am not Indian and have no connection to India, but I think that Cardano could be useful to help solve issues that they face and also to grow the Cardano eco-system.
On the surface issues in India might appear similar to Africa or South America, and there will be some overlap, but ideally local people identifying and solving local issues is best.
Emurgo has an office in India, but not sure what they are up to. IT in India is well established with a large pool of talent and skills available - we need to let them know about Cardano and the Catalyst funding. This proposal is intended to focus on India within a Fund8 challenge, with that challenge attracting actionable proposals to grow the community of developers and educators.
Some suggestions for that Fund8 challenge are:
Setting up local Cardano hubs for regular catch ups (virtual or real world)
Local-language websites/socials/YT set up to attract developers/entrepreneurs to explain Cardano and Catalyst at a high-level
Fund a dapp and create a how-to video in local-language as a walk through to help educate and reduce perceived complexity
Run a competition/pitch-fest for dapp ideas with the top 10 ideas get funded to make a MVP
Connect with universities and training centers
Connect with new and established Indian YouTube channels to talk Cardano tech, dev ideas, business opportunities etc to create a buzz about Catalyst funding
Regularly promote awareness of Cardano and Catalyst funding to bring people into the space eg a 12 month campaign
This is like a big heavy wheel that will take a lot of energy to get turning, but once it starts to move it will (hopefully) keep going with less energy needed.
How much ADA/USD should be available for this proposal?
I think it will take a few Catalyst rounds to build the Cardano interest in India, so the first round of investment during Fund8 should be \$150k. Subsequent funding rounds can be determined at the time and then voted on by the community.

Campaign Brief # As in Africa, raising the awareness levels of regular people in Latin America about blockchain technology and the Cardano protocol should be a priority for the Catalyst community. Providing the funding for those people who learn about our protocol to take advantage of the protocol and the support the community offers seems to be why we work together, doesn\u0026rsquo;t it?
Within our community we have some outstanding people from Latin America working with us to grow the ecosystem. Let\u0026rsquo;s give our fellow community members a funding category they can point to within their local communities as a means to take part in this revolution of technology.
The overwhelming majority of stake pools are based in North America and Europe. The Cardano protocol will be much more resilient and productive for people all around the world when the Catalyst community steps up and intentionally supports those who would like become a part of the stake pool network.
Some of the Catalyst community\u0026rsquo;s original members come from Latin America, let\u0026rsquo;s capitalize on that initiative and bring more people from this wonderful part of the world into the Cardano ecosystem.
Why is it Important? # The Cardano community is heavily based in North America and Europe.
Growth elsewhere requires our support and initiative as a community.
How does success look like? # A wide spectrum of people from Latin America or with connections to Latin America coming together and forming teams to grow our ecosystem.
Key Metrics to measure # Basic metrics to look for to determine the effectivity of this challenge will include:
The volume of proposals originated by Latin Americans participating in Project Catalyst. -The quality of those proposals as well as the impact on their local communities. Did we attract new members of the community from Latin American countries? Will we see an increase in transactions processed (blocks minted) in Latin America? New SPOs forming? What can we learn from funded proposals when it comes to building on the initial successfully funded proposals from this challenge setting? Will applications be developed that might be useful in other parts of the world?

Therefore, some specific guidelines are introduced, in addition to those of the traditional \u0026ldquo;Dapps \u0026amp; Integrations\u0026rdquo;, for the submission of a proposal in this challenge:
The budget should not exceed \$10000 They should be complete projects, usable by end users on delivery The delivery should take place within 3 months from funding As the release of smart contracts is imminent, it may make sense to create a specific challenge that will ensure at least 20 new applications to attract new users to Cardano in the next 3 months.
Guiding Questions # What are the key applications that underpin the application ecosystem on other platforms? What are the most profitable or most used applications on other ecosystems? What needs do users of Cardano have that could be solved by new applications? What applications deliver the highest amount of value with the least amount of technical sophistication? Potential directions Swaps, simple variants (multi-party etc.) Escrow, simple variants Integrations with existing products Why is it Important? # In recent funds many small Dapps haven\u0026rsquo;t been funded (but approved), as proposals with high budgets requests exhausted funds.
How does success look like? # At least 20 novel and viable small decentralized applications get built of top of Cardano in a short time horizon, attracting new users.

Why is it important? # For the poor nations with no basic foundations, Nation Building Dapp solutions will be the building blocks enabling sustainable prosperity.
What does success look like? # Increasing Dapp usage in developing nations, in collaboration with Cardano Local Community Centers and Intl Partnerships to serve its people
Key Metrics to measure # Number of proposals Proposals CA ratings Diversity of Dapp\u0026rsquo;s use cases Proposers commercial approach and negotiation strategy with different Governments Participation of Cardano\u0026rsquo;s Local Community Centers Participation and/or partnerships with other international organizations Number of countries covered, contracts signed Number of Dapp users, registry accounts, transaction volumes Proposers lead time on field research, Dapp development and implementation Dapps impact on social/financial inclusion Dapps impact on economic development Challenge Brief # For the poor nations with no foundations to stand on, Nation Building Dapp solutions will be the building blocks enabling sustainable prosperity. The 2017 Findex report shows that about a quarter of unbanked adults live in the poorest 20 percent of households in their country. Proposals in Nation Building Dapps will be able to help provide digital identities to these people and help them out of poverty. We want to encourage Cardano blockchain solutions that will be able to provide nations with decentralized solutions to their infrastructure by eliminating a single point of failure, protecting national, corporate, and individual data, property, and assets.

Campaign Brief # How might we make it faster and easier for new Catalyst members to take on suitable roles and responsibilities in 2022?
Why is it important? # The success of Catalyst depends on the availability of quality challenge teams, proposers, advisors, mentors and voters.
What does success look like? # A well-oiled open innovation platform where people fulfill roles that are meaningful for them and that contribute to shared success.
Key Metrics to measure # The metrics can be divided to two sections. General onboarding refers to bringing people in and converting them from mere lurkers to voters and potential proposers. Innovation process metrics refer to the quantity and quality of proposals and activity around them.
General onboarding # Weekly sign ups to Cardano Ideascale Townhall attendance Catalyst School session attendance Swarm session attendance Applications to leadership positions (e.g. Circle) Innovation process # Number of referrers Reduction in the number of unready proposals Growtn in the number of 4-5 star proposals Growth in the number of Community Advisors and Veteran Community Advisors Percentage of proposals with Excellent assessments Growth in the number of voters Growth in total number of votes given Challenge Brief # The growth of Project Catalyst depends on meaningful participation from proposers, advisors, mentors and voters who are both eager and capable to fulfill their roles and understand their responsibilities.
Guiding questions # How might we convert passive ADA holders into active Catalyst members? How might we increase awareness of Project Catalyst as the most active open innovation platform? How might we increase more meaningful participation from challenge teams, proposers, advisors, mentors and voters? What kind of additional roles are needed? How might we encourange new members to utillize the tools and services availalbe for onboarding? How might we improve the use of existing text, video and audio materials? `}),e.add({id:90,href:"/catalyst/fund7/challenges/new-spo-business-opportunities/campaign-brief/",title:"New SPO Business Opportunities",description:"Stake Pool Operators are a key-success-factor of Cardano.

Campaign Brief # Our SPOs are a most-valuable foundation of Cardano. They have invested in important infrastructure and are establishing important capabilities. This is of high value in the still very much hype-driven general Crypto space. With SPOs, the CARDANO Community can get both: Even more decentralization AND stability and professionalism at the same time.
On this bases, many new ideas and service can emerge, such as
Secure and censorship-resilient data storage KYC related service and access hubs Well, for sure many, many more ideas and opportunities In case of success, I can also see this as a recurring challenge setting, driving and optimising the economic well-being of our SPO\u0026rsquo;s and utilizing all their today\u0026rsquo;s and future capabilities in a most creative way.
Why is it Important? # Being an SPO shall be economically attractive. In addition to this, there are great opportunities for adding new ideas \u0026amp; services
How does success look like? # The overall business model of SPO\u0026rsquo;s can become even more attractive and we can add new features and services for driving decentralization

Campaign Brief # Propose a means or way to drive business use cases on Cardano that have NFT usage as a core component and can act as an onramp to the Cardano ecosystem. This can include any business model based on NFTs. Think about how this is implemented at scale drawing millions of users, who, once onboard, can become customers for dApps, tools, DeFi and other services.
This Challenge is about building recurring businesses that incorporate NFTs on the Cardano ecosystem. The more types of NFTs that are circulating on Cardano will increase the utility of Cardano and ADA.
What should be proposed? # Proposals should be framed towards specific use-cases, and the community will know of specific cases where NFTs can be used to solve various problems. Focusing on NFTs in general may be most productive, with a strong focus on business models that rely on NFTs as a core component of most transactions.
Why is it important? # NFTs have the potential to create businesses with recurring NFT use requirements which increase utilization of the Cardano blockchain.
How does success look like? # Many high quality ideas will be proposed that can substantially grow Cardano\u0026rsquo;s user-base, network-utility, network-value \u0026amp; ADA circulation.

Campaign Brief # This challenges aims too support the development of common tools needed for projects to make use of the cardano blockchain.
There are core functionalities that almost all Dapp projects need like querying the blockchain, managing wallets, creating transactions. These functionalities should be freely available to all and be owned by the community. Some of these solutions are currently only easily available as Software as a Service solution. If most Dapps are build on top of the same proprietary solutions to access the blockchain, however, this leads to centralization and introduces risk.
The goal of Cardano is to also include those who are currently being left out. If the best tools build with the community fund are behind a pay wall this creates an unfair playing field. Anyone who wants to start building on top of cardano should be able to easily configure a node with the utilities they need. Anyone who is hosting a node (as SPO or otherwise) should be able to easily add on and offer additional services as they see fit.
Large scale projects and singular solutions have proven to be inflexible and the industry is focusing on compositional design. Modern micro service architecture and solutions like containerization allow for common utilities to be developed as self-hosted independent building blocks. This approach allows projects to focus on a single functionality reducing the risk for the whole community.
Guiding Questions # How can we ensure future developers benefit from the work that is funded today? How do we promote a decentralised and self-hosted ecosystem? How do we align between different open source community efforts? Possible Directions # developing common tools as libraries or containerized services incentive system for developing \u0026amp; hosting common open source utility\u0026rsquo;s common audited repositories \u0026amp; overviews for open source solutions organising events to bring the open source community together collaborations/efforts on defining common standards Why is it Important? # There are core functionalities that most projects need, community owned open-source solutions can make them available to everyone
How does success look like? # A healthy mix of both private and public groups build on top off, and contribute to, a solid and open foundation for development
Key Metrics to measure # Success of this proposal should be measured through the adoption of open source solutions by other projects:
Usage of open source git repositories Usage of open source docker containers At the end of this challenge it should also be easier for developers to find existing tools that help their project.
Have we managed to create public visible overviews of exisitng open source and free tools?
Other metrics could involve participating number of devs on open source projects, though this can be hard to track. We can track if events have been organised and seen participation to support open source projects

Campaign Brief # How can we ensure that the Cardano ecosystem is built on a framework which is owned by the community and equally accessible to all?
Why is it important? # We need to grow an entire ecosystem of experts to build and maintain the foundations of Cardano/Catalyst together with the current IOG teams
What does success look like? # A growing number of experts join forces to build collaboratively on community owned infrastructure, tooling, standards, libraries and docs
Key Metrics to measure # increase the number and the quality of Cardano Open Source projects increase the number of contributors increase of open source tools and frameworks from the community for the community (dog-fooding) Challenge Brief # In the first iterations, Catalyst started as a Challenge proposed by the Catalyst team. Initially, the majority of its budget was destined to the Developer Ecosystem. For instance, in Fund 6, the Developer Ecosystem was assigned 1 mil. USD, that was 25% of the total 4 mil. available for the Fund.
In Fund 7, Catalyst released control of the budget to the community, which was able to choose the destination of the funding through voting. Unfortunately, the Developer Ecosystem challenge proposed for F7 was rejected because it did not receive enough votes. This led to the lack of an important resource stream that could have been used for the development of the Cardano technology.
Open Source Development Ecosystem challenge # The OSDE challenge aims to provide a stream of resources to teams that want to develop their projects and contribute back to the community by sharing part of their efforts in terms of open source projects, open-source frameworks, and accessible knowledge.
The main idea is that projects funded by the community can both generate business value retained by the teams, and at the same time contribute back to the community by improving the ecosystem itself.
For example, a team can be funded to develop a project; generate business value by leveraging a profitable idea, and share the non-core-business part of their work in terms of shared knowledge or in terms of building frameworks or projects with other teams - such that is possible to solve complex problems by joining minds and dividing the efforts across different teams.
Motivation # Catalyst exists to gradually work towards the final stage of the roadmap of Cardano: Voltaire. We are building tools to support new forms of governance and collaboration, on top of technology that is still being developed. The development of this technology itself, in the end, will have to become part of this same process as well. Such a complex and daunting task requires experts from a variety of disciplines to work together with a common goal.
Guiding questions # How can we ensure future efforts benefit from the work that is funded today? How do we align between different open source community efforts? What are the next steps to fuse IOG development with the community? How can we encourage experts to collaborate and share their knowledge and work? How can we develop a sustainable ecosystem while sharing knowledge and efforts? Possible directions # Education for development in the Cardano \u0026amp; Catalyst ecosystem Developing common tools, frameworks, core infrastructures, or proof of concepts Incentive systems for development \u0026amp; hosting Common audited repositories \u0026amp; overviews of existing solutions Organizing events to bring the development ecosystem together Collaboration to improve interoperability within the ecosystem `}),e.add({id:94,href:"/catalyst/fund8/challenges/open-standards-and-interoperability/campaign-brief/",title:"Open Standards \u0026 Interoperability",description:"Can we build an Open Ecosystem to drive growth, give equal opportunities to all, and increase the synergies across Cardano projects?",content:` Fund Size: 500,000 USD paid in Ada

Campaign Brief # Can we build an Open Ecosystem to drive growth, give equal opportunities to all, and increase the synergies across Cardano projects?
Why is it important? # To deliver complex software, driving collaboration, and accelerating innovation by sharing identity, practices, and sw components/services.
What does success look like? # A vendor-neutral ecosystem to
drive growth, awareness, discoverability
increase commercial adoption
provide needed infrastructures
Key Metrics to measure # Open standards adoption should increase among cardano projects. On the long term, all of the community-funded projects should be open and transparent by following common standards.
There should be observable improvements: easier to discover projects and find project resources, more intuitive to access project knowledge base (documentation, how-to, etc.), and simple to find and contact project members.
It should be possible to have project synergies by allowing simple inter-project communication, knowledge sharing, and re-use of existing components/services.
We should observe an increase in open-source contributions to different projects: both from new joiners and from other people already in the Cardano community
We should observe an increase in reputability of the Cardano Open Source projects. The measure can be done by looking at media communications of various open source communities.
Challenge brief # Open standards built on the principles of openness, transparency and consensus lay the grounds for innovation, growth and fair competition. Open standards are not synonymous of open source. [OPSTD]
We look at Open Source as the best way to enable interoperability between different technologies and applications. But in the Cardano Ecosystem we have a set of open source projects that have no standards for basic cross-project integration. For instance, there are no standards on how to document, set-up, and contribute-to projects. Moreover, there is no common infrastructure that the projects can use to track issues, and publish basic public information about the projects funded by the community.
We are of the advise that we need a set of standards, processes, and infrastructures to be used by the Cardano open source projects, such that (1) The teams of different O.S. projects can easily collaborate; (2) New-joiners can easily discover, understand, test, and contribute to existing O.S. projects; (3) Cardano O.S. projects can access a pool of basic infrastructures and tools that are needed.
Motivations # As mentioned by Charles Hoskinson \u0026ldquo;Cardano code is Open Source, but needs to be managed like a true open source project, like Linux and other O.S. projects\u0026rdquo;.
In order to proceed in this direction, we need to use Catalyst as a governance over a true, vendor-neutral open source and open-standards ecosystem. To achieve that, we are missing processes (e.g. how the project teams should behave and participate in the ecosystem), and infrastructures (e.g. VCS, CMS, Wiki, Forum, etc.)
Guiding questions # How can we guide the growth of a vendor neutral ecosystem? How can we build a common identity and increase awareness on Cardano projects? How can we increase the discoverability and the commercial adoption of our projects? How can we increase the degree of collaboration across different projects? How can we lower the barriers and increase open participation to our ecosystem? How can we provide equal opportunities to all projects no matter the size? Possible directions # Incentivize collaboration across projects to solve complex problems Introduce common standards and processes and incentivize their adoption across projects Provide cross-project infrastructures and tools needed to co-ordinate Ensure the existence of a cohesive knowledge base Support a network of professional technology ambassadors Note # This challenge builds on top of the existing F7 Open Source Developer Ecosystem and is loosely related to F8 Open Source Development Ecosystem (https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Open-Source-Development-Ecosystem/382213-48088)
Indeed, this challenge is about establishing standards, processes, and fostering interoperability across O.S. projects, while the \u0026ldquo;Open Source\u0026rdquo; challenges are more focused on growing the O.S. ecosystem by seed-funding open source projects for future challenges.
Shortly said: This challenge is about opennes, standardization, and interoperability across open source projects funded by the community, while the \u0026ldquo;open source\u0026rdquo; one is about increasing the number/quality of projects.

A selection of past-funded \u0026lsquo;Scale-Up Hubs\u0026rsquo;:
Homeless Hubs Cardano in South L.A Cardano in Buenos Aires Salmon Nation Hub What this means # Demand is growing for this category and we are only at the beginning of what is possible with a network of Cardano hubs globally. The network effect will take a hold at some point and when it does, we need to be ready with templates, guides and materials on creating and sustaining a new Cardano Community Hub (CCH). The impact is real and ROI is being met. Real lives are being affected and improved through this category. This creates a win-win, positive feedback loop as more people benefit from the solutions we offer them, there is even more demand for these services worldwide. How if the Fund 8 challenge different? # While the growing demand is showing us that the need is there, our focus for the next challenge should be on the other side of the coin. Capital supply.
While the facts have proven the necessity of a Community Hubs challenge, there are many other equally as important challenges vying for a position in Fund 8, so we must act accordingly. We must make budget requests that allow others to also pursue their goals within the ecosystem, both macro, for Catalyst and micro, within the Challenges themselves.
While we are Scaling UP community hubs, we need to Scale DOWN individual capital outlay, to ensure that we can spread as far as possible, as quickly as possible, which is why we work from first principles.
Delivering information to people who would not otherwise have the access. Ensuring resilience and self-reliance within that community. When we approach hubs from the lens of information-delivery nodes, we can build a hub taxonomy within a need-impact matrix and then find the most capital efficient model for each location. In simpler terms, consider why a hub exists, in the context of it\u0026rsquo;s location, access to infrastructure and community readiness. Then design a hub according to those factors, with a traditional brick-and-mortar (CTH) being only one out of many potential information-delivery systems within a local community.
This round will focus much more on \u0026lsquo;minimum-viable hubs\u0026rsquo; (MVHs), what is the smallest effective unit for a hub, and by identifying this unit, can we begin to scale CCHs more rapidly.
Additional Success Metrics:
Is the hub\u0026rsquo;s Fund 8 proposal in keeping with the MVH principle? Do they have an understanding of their target audience? Can they accurately project their reach (physical and online) in the first 3, 6, 12 months? Can they accurately project the number of onboarded members to the hub in 3, 6, 12 months? Have they given an indication of a financial sustainability model? Have they given an indication of budget costs vs \u0026lsquo;cost to launch\u0026rsquo;? (eg. A CTH may only apply for 1/5 of their cost to launch due to the demand pressures of acquiring catalyst funding) Ratings by CAs and Voters should favour:
Proposals that have a budget:cost-to-launch ratio between 1-1.5. Proposals that do not exceed 5% of the total Challenge budget. Proposals that account for local needs and infrastructure concerns. Proposals that show creativity and ingenuity around hub design and information delivery. Proposals that are using local, recyclable materials and have a commitment to sustainability practices. Let\u0026rsquo;s build an ecosystem that is truly global, allowing everyone to participate to the best of their ability, whatever level they are starting from.
When you drive adoption at the ground level, you are doing more than just \u0026lsquo;building cool products\u0026rsquo;, you are empowering people to change their lives in ways they could have never imagined by themselves.

Campaign Brief # Currently, the vast majority of DeFi dapps and assets flows occur on the Ethereum blockchain, however due to congestion and increased transaction fees, the use of DeFi is increasingly elitized, leaving out the people who could most benefit from it, the unbanked.
Over the past year several DeFi projects have been moving to more scalable blockchains, such as Binance Smart Chain, Polkadot, Cosmos, Solana, among others. Second layer solutions are also being used as alternatives to Ethereum main chain, Polygon has been a great example.
In this migration and bridges creation scenario, some projects are turning to Cardano to create their DeFi projects.
Cardano is finally delivering smart contracts and that opens a door to a lot of innovation in DeFi. We can offer not only a scalable blockchain, but also a secure blockchain and aggregated governance layer in the near future. This set of characteristics place Cardano in a prominent place and with a good opportunity to gain market share and expand the user base.
With Catalyst, we have the opportunity to fund DeFi projects and allow them to have greater decentralization and resilience, which are essential aspects for DeFi projects. Many projects end up accepting the participation of Venture Capitals due to lack of financial resources. The participation of VCs in DeFi projects usually ends up causing a large part of the supply distribution to be alocated to VCs and this compromises the decentralization and consequently the security of these projects.
The DeFi ecosystem today is taken over by projects full of vulnerabilities, hacks are constant, economic models are copied from other projects, decentralization is no longer a priority and few projects are dedicated to create economic models/bonding curves/algorithms thinking about the users\u0026rsquo; needs.
It has become clear over the year that bugs, hacks and vulnerabilities are not unique to smart contracts on Ethereum. Dapps running on Binance Smart Chain and Cosmos suffered from vulnerabilities as well.
Hackers stole at least \$600M in Poly exploit across three chains
Thorchain suffers \$5 million exploit, developers have put out a fix
Cardano arrives to change this paradigm and bring security to users.
Privacy and resistance to censorship are also important but often overlooked in favor of subsidizing (yield farming). How to encourage DeFi projects to seek resilience, safety, research-based economic models and critical thinking?
Potential Directions # DEXs Oracles Algorithmic stable coins Borrowing/Lending dapps Derivatives Research for open source new financial models (bonding curves) Rational For Budget Distrobution # New or less popular teams have difficulty competing with influential and popular teams in the Cardano community. Even ensuring a good score is difficult to get engagement in the voting stage to compete with consolidated and influential teams in the Cardano community.
This challenge intends to sow new teams, who have never received funding from Catalyst so they can have a chance to show their value to the community.
Each new team can request up to 25% of the total \$200,000 USD budget, also know as \$50,000 USD.
E.g.
Team A with 2 proposals of \$25,000 USD Team B with 5 proposals of \$10,000 USD Team C with 1 proposal of \$50,000 USD Team D with 1 proposal of \$15,000 USD + 1 proposal of \$35,000 US Why is it Important? # So that new teams can have a kickstart in their projects without having to resort to ICOs and VCs allocation.
How does success look like? # At least 4 new teams deploying DeFi Dapps on Cardano in 2022 + Managing to form a community in order to gain competitiveness/sustainability
Key Metrics to measure # How many DeFi dapps were launched on Cardano mainnet within 3, 6 and 12 months after funding. How many daily active users are the DeFi dapps funded in this cohort attracting. How long does each dapp take to be launched. How much Total Value Locked (TVL) are the funded DeFi dapps able to capture 3, 6 and 12 months after launch. Number of bugs and vulnerabilities found in each dapp. Amount of resources lost due to bugs or vulnerabilities. Number of users participating in testnets. Number of token holders/unique wallet(when dapp has a token). Distribution of supply between the team and the community. Numbers of listed pairs (in case of DEXs). Number of listed assets (cases of loan+lending dapps, derivatives and synthetic assets). Number of articles and open source financial models research delivered to the community. `}),e.add({id:102,href:"/catalyst/fund8/challenges/self-sovereign-identity/campaign-brief/",title:"Self-Sovereign Identity",description:"How can we take the next step to support the principles of self-sovereign identity?",content:` Fund Size: 400,000 USD paid in Ada

Campaign Brief # How can we take the next step to support the principles of self-sovereign identity?
Why is it important? # We have the potential to be leaders in the SSI ecosystem, assuring trust and giving individuals control of their digital identities.
What does success look like? # Receiving high quality projects; growing participation on SSI discussions; partnering with ecosystem, governance and working groups
Key Metrics to measure # The number of proposals that directly address SSI in a quantifiable manner The quality of proposals measured by community interest and engagement Awareness of Cardano inside the SSI community, working groups and governance entities Challenge Brief # Catalyst Project by its Fund 6 and Fund 7 has promoted projects that push adoption of the Decentralized Identity and Atala Prism SDK. Additionally, a first cohort was part of the Atala PRISM Pioneer Program and a second one is ready to start.
The amount and quality of projects proposed so far and the involvement of the community in the matters of Decentralized Identity are clear indicators that Cardano is ready to make the big move to cope with all aspects of the Self-Sovereign Identity ecosystem.
This challenge is looking for projects that help position Cardano as one of the leaders in the SSI space. With a broader scope than past challenges, we expect this one to tackle all layers defined by the Trust over IP Foundation.
Some directions that projects can take are: # Participation and adoption growth Portability Usability and accessibility Governance frameworks Interoperability Privacy and minimal disclosure (Zero Knowledge Proofs) Security Regulation Business models NFT and Smart Contracts integration Trust registries Equity and inclusion Philosophical implications `}),e.add({id:103,href:"/catalyst/fund8/challenges/the-great-migration-from-ethereum/campaign-brief/",title:"The Great Migration (from Ethereum)",description:"How might we make it easy and fast for dApps and other projects to expand or completely move from Ethereum to Cardano?",content:` Fund Size: 500,000 USD paid in Ada

Campaign Brief # How might we make it easy and fast for dApps and other projects to expand or completely move from Ethereum to Cardano?
Why is it important? # Many projects are stuck on EVM-based blockchains like Ethereum and are looking for an escape. Cardano can be faster and cheaper to use.
What does success look like? # Projects who were either planning to or did launch on an EVM-based blockchain deploy in the Cardano ecosystem and can do so easily.
Key Metrics to measure # Number of projects that migrate Number of users of these smart contracts once migrated to the Cardano ecosystem (Metrics can either be improved by funding projects that directly deploy something, or projects that help build tooling to make it easier to deploy)
Challenge Brief # The Cardano ecosystem, despite being written in Haskell, has always had plans to provide a path for projects that either deployed on an EVM-based blockchain (like Ethereum) to migrate to the Cardano ecosystem. Additionally, projects that are better suited for the account-style method (instead of UTXO) also exist, and we want these projects to be usable from the Cardano ecosystem as well.
To accomplish this part of the roadmap, many efforts are currently underway such as KEVM, IELE, ERC20 Converter and Milkomeda to name a few. These projects are reaching the point where they are mature enough for people to deploy using them or build tooling for them and so it\u0026rsquo;s time to start welcoming projects to Cardano.
You can hear Charles talk about the importance of this in his video \u0026ldquo;The Island, The Ocean and the Pond\u0026rdquo;
